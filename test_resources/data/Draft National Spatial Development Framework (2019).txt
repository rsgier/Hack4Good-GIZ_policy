GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Apartheid
A political system and its laws and policies directed towards the 
separation of different ethnic or racial groups. Spatially, apartheid 
involved the physical separation of the four racial groups according to the 
Population Registration Act of 1950 into so-called “Group Areas”
according to the Group Areas Act of 1950. A system of ethnically-based 
“Bantustans” for Black South Africans was also established.
Bantustan
Areas reserved for African occupation under the Apartheid government.
Approximately13% of the total area of South Africa was divided into ten 
such Bantustans and were given some degree of self-rule, but always 
subject to the wishes and needs of the Apartheid government. While these 
areas were incorporated back into South Africa at the dawn of 
democracy in 1994, they still suffer the consequences of long-term 
neglect, isolation and poverty.
Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas
Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), are 
natural areas of critical importance for ecological sustainability, and 
should be kept in their natural, or at least semi-natural, state. Critical 
Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) are divided into two sub-categories: CBA1 and 
CBA2. CBA1s are irreplaceable, which means that there are no other 
places in the landscape where the conservation and ecological 
objectives associated with those CBAs can be met. In CBA2s, there may 
be some options for meeting the conservation and ecological objectives 
associated with those CBAs in other parts of the landscape. However, this 
can only be done at the cost of losing some of the spatial efficiency of 
the network of CBAs. If a CBA2 is lost and an alternative natural area 
elsewhere is identified to become part of the CBA network, the alternative 
area is likely to be larger, increasing the size of the CBA-network as a 
whole. Areas identified as ESAs should be kept in at least semi-natural 
condition, i.e. with their basic ecological functioning still intact.
City
A human settlement characterised by (1) large and generally diverse 
communities of people living at high residential densities, (2) a variety of 
employment opportunities, and (3) high-intensity business and 
commercial areas.
Concentration
Concentration of people and activities refers to (1) a higher density of 
people, and (2) a higher intensity and mix of activities in a specific place, 
area or region. Generally, such concentration supports the development 
and sustenance of agglomeration economies. This can take the form of 
urbanisation economies (where cost decreases as total output of an 
urban area increases) or localisation economies (where costs decrease 
as firms in a specific industry increase output).
Decentralisation
The flow of people and economic activities from an urban centre or node 
to outlying (suburban and/or peri-urban) areas or nodes. 
Densification
The process of increasing the number of people living in a specific area to 
ensure that (1) better use is made of movement infrastructure, services, 
ICT networks and amenities by a greater number of people, and (2) the 
need for expansion of existing grids, networks and services is reduced.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 16
Development Corridor
Integrated linear networks of infrastructure and economic activity. 
Development corridors typically fulfil a variety of multiple, complex 
functions, such as (1) the movement of people and freight, (2) facilitating 
trade between areas, (3) flows of information, (4) flows of services such as 
water and gas, and (5) facilitating tourism. Supportive functions may be 
located in corridors, e.g. logistics. Development corridors often also 
include a human settlement and/or economic activity component, e.g. 
higher-density transit-oriented mixed-use development or industrial 
development adjacent to, or along the main transport routes.
Diversification
The process of introducing and/or allowing a greater mix of land uses in 
an area, to (1) boost local people-to-people service economies, stimulate 
co-production of knowledge innovation and create jobs, (2) reduce the 
need for travel and travel distances, (3) bring more vibrancy and life to an 
area; (4) enhance social interaction and cohesion, and (5) make better 
use of available land. 
Ecological Footprint
A measure of the ‘load’ imposed by a given population on natural 
systems. The bigger the footprint, the greater the impact.
Ecological Infrastructure
Ecological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that 
generate or deliver valuable services to people, e.g. water catchments, 
wetlands, riparian zones, coastal dunes, kelp beds or spawning grounds. 
Ecological infrastructure consists of a network of interconnected structural 
elements in the landscape and seascape. 
Economic Sectors
A description of the kind of economic activities in a country, or the 
activities in which the population of a country are active/working. The 
following five categories/sectors of economic activity are generally used 
in this regard: (1) the primary sector, which includes agriculture, mining 
and other natural resource-based industries; (2) the secondary sector,
which entails manufacturing, engineering and construction; (3) the 
tertiary sector, meaning the service industries; (4) the quaternary sector, 
which refers to intellectual activities involving education and research;
and (5) the quinary sector, which is reserved for the economic activities of 
high-level decision makers in government and industry.i In some instances, 
including this NSDF, the last two sectors are included in the definition of 
the tertiary sector.
Ecosystem
The dynamic and complex interplay of animal, plant, and micro-organism 
communities and their non-living environment (soil, water, climate and 
atmosphere) as a functional unit. 
Ecosystem Services
The beneficial services that nature provide to people. Ecosystem services 
are typically grouped into four broad categories: (1) provisioning,
including the production of food and water; (2) regulating, including the 
control of climate and disease; (3) supporting, including nutrient cycles 
and oxygen production; and (4) cultural, including spiritual and 
recreational benefits.
Evidence Mapping
A structured process of seeking, ordering and making sense of relevant 
published and unpublished research (i.e. ‘evidence’) to inform the 
preparation and review of policy and legislation. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 17
Food Security
A condition of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable
and nutritious food, through locally-grown produce and/or imports.
Hinterland
The sparsely populated areas close to an urban settlement or node in 
which people farm or depend on natural resources for their livelihood,
including the villages and small towns that are dispersed throughout these 
areas.
Human Settlement
A place where people live, work, study and relax. A settlement can range 
in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to a large city 
or groups/conglomerations of cities tied together through dense transport
and communication networks.
Infrastructure
The basic equipment, utilities, productive enterprises, installations, and 
services essential for the development, operation, and growth of human 
settlements and economic activities. Infrastructure includes items such as 
roads, utility lines for water, sanitation and electricity, drainage structures 
and communication technology. A distinction is often made between (1) 
engineering infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, sewerage, water,
and (2) social infrastructure, which can broadly be defined as the 
construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services,
such as health, education, community, welfare support, citizen 
registration and cultural facilities.
Land-Use Pattern
The land-use pattern is a general description of how land is occupied or 
used, and how land-uses tend to be distributed across a specific 
geographic area. In the context of the NSDF, the national land-use 
pattern is a high-level description of how the (1) population, (2) 
settlements, (3) economic activities, and (4) natural areas are distributed 
and systemically-related within the country as a whole.
Land Reform
The process of correcting the historical imbalances in (1) ownership of 
land, and (2) access to land. It entails three types of intervention by the 
State, viz. (1) land restitution, meaning the redress of wrongs committed 
during the colonial and Apartheid eras; (2) land redistribution, meaning 
the provision of land for residential and economic purposes to those who 
do not have the means to access land); and (3) tenure reform, meaning 
the provision of security of tenure.
National Development Paradigm
The overarching set of ideas and beliefs and its associated legal and 
policy framework, setting out how (1) a country should be developed, (2) 
its economic relations should be structured, (3) the benefits of its
economic system should be shared, and (4) its natural resources should 
be used and managed.
National Social and Economic Interactions
The dense network of social and economic activities that take place in a 
country.
National Spatial Development Framework
A long-term national spatial planning instrument with a long-term horizon 
that (1) is mandated by the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management 
Act, 2013 (SPLUMA), (2) has to be aligned with the National Development 
Plan (NDP), and (3) is adopted by Cabinet as official national spatial 
development policy for implementation throughout the country. As such, National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 18
it provides (1) an overarching spatial development framework including a 
set of principle-driven spatial investment and development directives for 
all three spheres and sectors of government, meaning ‘where, when, 
what type, and how much to invest and spend throughout the country’; 
and (2) a set of strategic spatial areas of national importance from an 
ecological, social, economic and/or ICT or movement infrastructure 
perspective, to be targeted by both government and the private sector 
in the pursuit of strategic national development objectives, or to avert 
national crises.
National Spatial Development Logic
The approach to, and the way in which national space is used and 
managed in pursuit of the objectives of the prevailing national 
development paradigm.
National Spatial Development Pattern
The outcomes of the national spatial development logic of a country in 
national space. As such, it entails (1) where, how and for whom 
settlements are built, (2) the land tenure types and land-use patterns in 
these settlements, and (3) the type, mix, density, intensity and distribution 
of land-uses in these settlements.
Natural Resource Foundation
The natural resources of a country, consisting of both ecosystem services 
and sensitive and important ecological systems. These resources need to 
be defined, mapped and protected, preferably by law, and their 
utilisation carefully managed for the benefit of the ecological system and 
the sustenance of future generations.
Node
Nodes are concentrations and clusters of activities of varying intensity and 
density, and can be either mixed-use or mono-functional (e.g. an office 
node).
Polycentric system
A functionally integrated system of settlements/nodes of varying size that 
co-exist and collaborate in mutually beneficial ways, and in doing so, 
enhance the resilience of the system and its constituent parts. The system 
allows the provision of a series of social and other services by (1) using the 
unique qualities of the various settlements/nodes in the system, and (2) 
harnessing the connections between them.
Protected Area
An area of special natural, ecological, architectural or historic interest that 
is protected by law. The protected areas referred to in this NSDF are those 
areas that are officially classified as such in terms of the National 
Environmental Management Act, 1998.
Rural
Generally regarded as areas outside cities and towns. Economic activity
in these areas is in most cases intrinsically tied to natural resource use 
and/or beneficiation, and consists of agriculture, fishing, forestry, nature 
conservation, eco-tourism and mining. In South Africa, there are rural 
areas that are densely populated, but without (1) the distinct and diverse 
nodal areas of dense economic activity in the secondary and the tertiary 
sectors, or (2) the amenities typically associated with urban areas. These 
areas are a remnant of colonial and Apartheid spatial planning and the 
creation of Bantustans. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 19
Rural Development
The process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of 
people living in a rural area, by planned interventions in the area in (1) the 
ownership and use of land, (2) the provision, maintenance and upgrading 
of infrastructure and social services, and (3) the type and intensity of 
economic activities.
Rural Edge
A line that is used to delineate a systemically-integrated area/region that 
has distinct rural qualities that need to be protected from ‘intruding’ uses 
that may disrupt or destroy these qualities. Typically, the delineation would 
be accompanied by (1) a description of the kinds of activities that are 
permitted within the area/region, and (2) the procedures to apply for uses 
that are not specified as such. The line may have coordinates and be 
statutory, meaning it has binding legal power, or be seen as a soft or ‘fuzzy 
line’, meaning its exact coordinates are not defined, and it is to be used 
in a planning and policy sense and not as hard, impenetrable physical 
line.
Ruralisation
The process by which (1) people choose to remain in rural areas because 
there are viable economic opportunities, move back to towns and 
villages in rural areas from urban areas, and/or build/renovate houses in 
these areas as ‘homes’ for their current needs, or with a view to retirement,
and (2) the State plans for the development of rural areas in a systemic 
and holistic way as economically viable, ecologically-significant, 
productive quality living spaces, as opposed to colonial and Apartheid 
times in which the little investment that was made in these areas was 
focused on advancing white economic interests in urban areas, and/or 
the lives and life chances of white people living in rural towns.
Settlement (also known as ‘Human Settlement’)
A settlement refers to a place where people live, work, study and relax. A 
settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped 
together, to a large city or groups/conglomerations of cities tied together 
through dense transport and communication networks.
Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)
A recently introduced government instrument that seeks to enhance the 
process of formulating policies, Acts and regulations by ensuring (1) 
alignment of such interventions with national priorities, (2) mitigation of 
risks, (3) anticipation of unintended consequences, and (4) minimisation 
of costs and maximisation of benefits.
Space Economy
The spatial drivers and spatial manifestations and outcomes of the 
economic interactions and transactions that (1) are generated in 
‘earth/terra-based space’, (2) take place in that space, and/or (3) flow 
through that space. The size, nature, scale and scope of the space 
economy of a place/area is related to (1) its unique locational, spatial, 
ecological, economic, social, institutional, infrastructural, mineral, soils and 
topographical attributes, culture, and history, and (2) its level of 
connectedness to, and relations with other places/areas, and the unique 
attributes and space economies of those places it is connected to, or 
transacts with.
Spatial Planning
The process of making strategic decisions as to (1) how and for what 
purpose public, communal and private-owned land in an area (it could 
be a street, town, province, country or continent) is to be used and 
developed in an environmentally sustainable, economically viable and 
affordable way, and (2) how these land portions are to be connected to National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 20
each other through road and rail networks and served with basic service 
infrastructure (water, electricity and sanitation) and communication 
networks (cellular, wi-fi and fibre).
Spatial Transformation
The carefully-planned and well-managed process of placing 
infrastructure, social services and economic activities in settlements in 
such a way that (1) the segregated spatial patterns inherited from colonial 
and Apartheid times are broken down, and (2) the inefficiencies, injustices 
and inequalities in access to opportunities resulting from these past 
patterns are corrected.
Strategic Water Source Areas
Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) can be described as ‘water 
factories’ that support growth and development needs that are often a 
long distance away from the SWSAs themselves. These areas contribute 
significantly to the overall surface and ground water supply of the country. 
While Strategic Water Source Areas have been identified by the Water 
Research Commission (2015), they are not formally protected.
Stressed Catchments
‘Water stress’ occurs when the amount of water used exceeds 10% of 
renewable resources. Water stress depends on a range of factors and is 
not simply a shortfall in water availability versus requirement. Water deficits 
will not be experienced the same over an entire Water Management 
Area, nor at all times. In some cases, the deficits do not imply that 
consumptive use exceeds the available water, but that the allowances 
made for the implementation of the ecological component of the reserve
cannot be met fully at present levels of use. Stressed catchments are also 
impacted upon by ‘water demand/requirement’, which refers specifically 
to the ‘beneficial, effective and efficient use of water’, which can be 
improved through, for example, a reduction in water losses.
Supra-National
Refers to (1) ‘regions’, organisations and structures that are created 
‘above the nation state’ by two or more countries, e.g. the African Union 
and the Southern African Development Community, to attend to matters 
of mutual concern and/or that lie outside the control/reach of a single 
country, and (2) agreements, protocols, policies, plans and investment 
frameworks prepared for these bigger supra-national entities.
Sustainable Development
Development that meets the needs of the present generation without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 
The definition of sustainable development usually refers to social, 
economic and institutional components.
Theory of Change
A story of how things, settings or situations can and will be changed 
through a well-planned and sequenced set of actions and interventions, 
to bring about a desired goal, situation or state of affairs.
Town
A place where people and services are geographically concentrated in 
a distinct and identifiable area. While towns can vary in size, they tend to 
have a smaller population, lower residential densities, fewer employment 
opportunities and fewer and/or smaller economic activities than cities.
Township
This term has two meanings in the South African context. Firstly, it is a 
colloquial name given to residential townships which were established National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 21
during the colonial and Apartheid eras for temporary occupation by Black 
South Africans on the outskirts of towns and cities, and where only the most 
basic of amenities and infrastructure were provided. During colonial times, 
these townships were called “locations”, and sometimes still are, albeit 
increasingly less so. Secondly, it is the legal name given to new human 
settlements and extensions to existing settlements in planning legislation,
e.g. “Sunnyside Extension 3”, dating back to the first Town Planning 
Ordinances passed in the early 1900s, and also appearing in the more 
recent Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (2013) (SPLUMA). 
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
A planned intervention that promotes higher density and mixed-use land 
development close to significant transit routes. TODs aim to (1) make the 
best use of land located along such routes, (2) increase ridership/use of 
public transport on the routes, and (3) promote sustainable urban 
development.
Urban
A term that refers to a city, being in a city, or ‘of a city’. Urban areas are 
characterised by (1) large communities living at high residential densities, 
(2) a variety of employment opportunities, and (3) high-intensity business 
and commercial areas. The ‘urban-rural distinction’ between cities and 
towns varies from country to country, and is most often based on a 
combination of factors related to population size, level of economic 
output and development density. Generally, large towns are considered 
as ‘urban’, whereas small towns are most often regarded as ‘rural’. ‘Urban 
regions’ in the context of the NSDF refer to large and growing, functionally 
integrated, built-up regions, that are characterised by areas of high 
residential density and economic intensity where the population exceeds 
more than two million inhabitants.
Urban Development
The process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of 
people living in an urban area through planned interventions in the area 
in (1) the ownership and use of land, (2) the provision, maintenance and 
upgrading of infrastructure and social services, and (3) the type and 
intensity of economic activities.
Urban Edge
A line that is used as a border to distinguish between (1) an area/region 
that is regarded as part of a city or town, and (2) its surrounding natural or 
rural area. Its primary purpose is to ‘contain the urban’ and as such, (1) no 
urban development is permitted, and (2) no municipal services are to be 
provided outside/beyond the line. As in the case of a rural edge, the line 
may have coordinates and be statutory, meaning it has binding legal 
power, or be seen as a ‘fuzzy/soft line’, meaning its exact coordinates are 
not defined, and it is to be used in a planning and policy sense and not as 
a hard, impenetrable physical line.
Urbanisation
The process by which an increasing percentage of a country’s population 
(1) moves to live in large towns and cities with the intention of staying there 
or in a similar urban area, and not returning to the countryside, and (2) is 
born in an urban area.
Water Scarce Regions
This construct refers to (1) the ‘climate capability’ of a region, which is a 
function of the moisture supply, climate constraints and physiological 
capacity of a region, and (2) the impact of climatic factors on the 
capability to grow an agricultural crop in a region within a growth season. 
For the purposes of the NSDF, areas described as ‘Water Scarce Regions’
fall within the ‘low to low-moderate’ climate capability ranges.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 22
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This National Spatial Development Framework (NSDF), the first of its kind, seeks to 
make a bold and decisive contribution to bringing about the peaceful, prosperous 
and truly transformed South Africa, as articulated in the Freedom Charter, the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme and the National Development Plan. 
It does so in full recognition of:
• The stranglehold that the unjust national spatial development paradigms,
logics and patterns of the past have placed on our many attempts at 
breaking the back of poverty, unemployment and inequality;
• The valuable, and often hard lessons we have learnt over the last twentyfive years in our pursuit of national reconstruction, inclusive economic 
growth and spatial transformation; and
• The necessity for decisive, collaborative and targeted state action in 
national space, to drive our country towards the shared, inclusive and 
sustainable future we desire and require.
In accordance with this transformative agenda, and guided by the Spatial Planning 
and Land Use Management Act, Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA), the NSDF consists of 
seven interrelated parts:
• Part One (1) provides an overview of the background to, need for and role
of the NSDF, (2) locates it within the context of the National Development 
Plan (NDP), and (3) sets out the NSDF’s theory of change to move the 
country from where we are, to the South Africa we want and need;
• Part Two provides an overview of the process that was followed in the 
compilation of the NSDF, including (1) the data that was gathered and 
processed, (2) the work-sessions that were held, and (3) the consultations 
and engagements that were undertaken;
• Part Three provides a high-level overview of a series of significant national 
spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities that impact 
upon, and shape both (1) the national development landscape, and (2) 
our ability to realise our national development goals; 
• Part Four (1) puts forward the national spatial development vision of a 
shared and just South Africa, (2) sets out the ‘shifts’ that must be made in 
the national spatial development logic based on the objectives and 
directives of the NDP and the SPLUMA principles, to enable a radical, 
transformative and decisive change in our national spatial development 
pattern, (3) puts forward six national spatial development levers to give 
spatial expression to the national spatial development vision, and support 
the shifts that need to be made in accordance with the new national 
spatial development logic, (4) provides a set of five required national spatial 
outcomes to achieve the national development objectives, as outlined in 
the NDP, and realise the national spatial development vision and desired 
national spatial development pattern, as outlined in the NSDF, and (5) gives
an indication as to what life would be like in our country by 2050 if the vision 
is pursued, the necessary shifts are made and the six national spatial 
development levers are appropriately and effectively used;
• Part Five provides national spatial development and investment guidance
in the form of (1) an ideal national spatial development pattern, (2) five
NSDF sub-frames, and (3) five national spatial action areas, to inform, direct 
and guide all infrastructure investment and development spending 
decisions by government and the private sector, to enable us to achieve 
the desired national spatial development pattern for South Africa in 2050, 
and in doing so, realise our national development objectives, as set out in 
the NDP;
• Part Six deals with the implementation of the NSDF, and (1) outlines the 
measures, approach and actions required to realising our national spatial 
development vision in a coherent, diligent and systematic way, and (2) 
provides an overview of the role-players involved in doing so; and
• Part Seven provides a summary of, and conclusion to the NSDF. 
While the NSDF recognises the challenges involved in bringing about the 
necessary changes in planning, budgeting and implementation in and 
between the three spheres of government, it is also very clear as to their 
importance in contributing to the joint crafting of our desired and shared future. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 23
PART ONE: IntroductionNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 24
1.1 Setting the Scene
In his first State of the Nation Address, President Cyril Ramaphosa, in 
recognition of the exemplary struggle, conquest and spirit of our former 
President Nelson Mandela, stated:
“In celebrating the centenary of Nelson Mandela, we are 
not merely honouring the past, we are building the future. 
We are continuing the long walk he began, to build a 
society in which all may be free, in which all may be equal 
before the law and in which all may share in the wealth of 
our land and have a better life. We are building a country 
where a person’s prospects are determined by their own 
initiative and hard work, and not by the colour of their skin, 
place of birth, gender, language or income of their 
parents”.ii
Transitioning a country like South Africa with its dreadful history and 
stubbornly persistent legacy of the past into a better place for all, is no 
easy task, as was clearly articulated in the recently released report by 
the High-Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and the 
Acceleration of Fundamental Change, where it states the following:
“Colonialism and apartheid have left South Africa with a 
deeply divided and inequitable distribution of people and 
economic activity. This spatial inequality traps 
disadvantaged communities in poverty and 
underdevelopment, creates inefficient cities, and robs 
poor, rural people of secure livelihoods. The Panel makes 
recommendations that seek to break this damaging spatial 
pattern that is built on past laws, which marginalised the 
black majority to the outskirts of the cities and to 
Bantustans, to preserve key assets, economic opportunities 
and the wealth of the country for the white minority. The 
legacy of spatial inequality appears intractable despite 
the National Development Plan and the Spatial Planning 
and Land Use Management’s (SPLUMA’s) focus on it. This 
issue needs an integrated solution that goes beyond the 
mandate of any one government department or specific 
level of government.”iii
The importance of space and land, and their densely interwoven 
connections to economic development and livelihoods, was also 
recognised in the Reconstruction and Development Programme in 1994, 
where it was argued that:
“No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass 
of our people remains in poverty, without land, without 
tangible prospects for a better life. Attacking poverty and 
deprivation must therefore be the first priority of a 
democratic government.”iv
1.2 The National Transformation Logic & Space
Encapsulated in the three preceding powerful statements, is a ‘national 
transformation logic’ with a distinct spatial dimension (see Figure 1), 
which can be expressed as follows:
Our new, post-Apartheid ‘national development 
paradigm’, which includes (1) a set of progressive national 
economic, social and spatial development objectives, 
values and ideals, and (2) an enabling and supporting 
national legal and policy framework, seeks to bring about National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 25
a new, post-Apartheid future. Realising this desired future, 
however, requires a new, post-Apartheid ‘national spatial 
development logic’ and ‘national spatial development 
vision’. 
Our current ‘national spatial development pattern’ is an 
outcome of the ‘national development paradigms’ and
the ‘national spatial development logics and visions’ of (1) 
the colonial and Apartheid eras, as well as (2) the first two 
decades of democracy. This ‘national spatial development 
pattern’ is an enabler, driver and facilitator of a multitude 
of ‘national social and economic interactions’. These 
interactions, in turn, (1) shape the ‘national spatial 
development pattern’, either reinforcing and sustaining it, 
or changing it, and (2) confirm, or question the objectives, 
values, ideals, laws and policies that constitute the new, 
post-Apartheid ‘national development paradigm’, and 
prompt its amendment, as and where required.
Moving from our current, undesirable ‘national spatial 
development pattern’ to the desired new, post-Apartheid
‘national spatial development pattern’, requires targeted 
and sustainable interventions in all four the components of 
the ‘national transformation logic’, in accordance with a 
credible and robust ‘theory of change’, which the NSDF 
puts forward.
Before getting to the NSDF’s theory of change and the targeted, 
coordinated and integrated (1) infrastructure investment and (2) social 
and economic development expenditure it requires, it is important to get 
a sense of (1) what has been done, and (2) what we need to start doing, 
stop doing, do more of, and do less of. This is done in the following section
(Section 1.3), which in turn is followed by a section (Section 1.4.3) in which 
the NSDF’s theory of change is set out.
Figure 1: The National Transformation LogicNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 26
1.3 Taking Stock: National Spatial Development 
and the need for a NSDF
In this section, the following are considered: (1) where we come from and 
what needs to be undone, (2) what we have done and accomplished, 
and (3) what more, or what else still needs to be done and undone. This 
assessment is used to decide what changes we need to make, and the 
way in which the NSDF intends doing so.
1.3.1 Where do we come from and what needs to be done 
and undone?
In engaging the issues of ‘space’, ‘spatial planning’ and ‘land’, it is 
important to recognise the spatial objectives and logic of the colonial 
and Apartheid Eras, and their different, but equally divisive, underlying 
economic and social logics.
(a) The Colonial Era
In terms of the colonial national development paradigm, all economic 
activities (hunting, farming and mining) were done on land annexed by 
force, or through unfair ‘deals’ that benefitted the colonial empire. The 
resulting national spatial development logic consisted of railroads 
connecting mines and large farming clusters in the interior to harbours at 
the coast. From here, (1) commodities were exported, and (2) imports 
(primarily manufactured goods) were received and carried by rail into 
the interior. This logic laid the foundation for the country’s infrastructure 
development pattern. 
With the discovery of gold and diamonds, largely unplanned settlements 
sprang up. In accordance with the prevailing colonial development 
paradigm, these settlements were developed with only the benefit of the 
colonists in mind. The indigenous population was (1) forcefully removed 
from their land to make place for the economic activities and related 
settlements, and (2) economically coerced though taxation and loss of 
land, to provide labour to white-owned farms, mines and industries to 
make a living.
Land use and land development decisions were made only with the 
benefit of the colonists in mind. Spatial planning legislation and policy 
was ad hoc and responded to the immediate needs for regulation, order 
and colonial exploitation and accumulation. In the rapidly-emerging 
towns and cities, the resulting national spatial development pattern
consisted of racially-separated settlements in which white people 
enjoyed (1) a privileged status, and (2) by and large, decent housing 
conditions. Black people were denied choice, dignity and respect, and 
treated as objects to support production by providing their labour at very 
low wages, and forced into so-called “locations” on the outskirts of these
settlements. 
(b) The Apartheid Era
The coming to power of the National Party in 1948, and the subsequent 
introduction of the racist national development ideology/paradigm of 
“Apartheid” brought about a new, carefully-conceived, allencompassing set of laws and policies focused on systematic racial 
segregation, exclusion and suppression. These laws and policies (1) built 
on, (2) reinforced the exclusionary and exploitative national spatial 
development logic, and (3) entrenched and deepened the unjust and 
fragmented national spatial development pattern of the colonial era. 
However, in contrast to (1) the earlier settler logic, ‘a new country’ was 
now being crafted for the exclusive use and advancement of a white 
‘South African’ minority, and (2) the earlier colonial era, indigenous 
Africans were now not only viewed as a source of cheap labour, but also National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 27
an increasingly vocal and numerically superior threat to ‘the new 
country’ and its white minority. To overcome this threat and develop the 
country, (1) the use of land and (2) the spatial relation of land-uses to 
each other, became of strategic importance. The resulting ‘survive, 
suppress and rule’ Apartheid national spatial development logic entailed 
the location of ‘labour’ as far away as possible from the country’s 
economic hubs, but still within ‘economically-feasible exploitation 
distance’, i.e. as far away as the cost of rudimentary mass transport 
would permit. This hideous pursuit at one point even entailed the 
Apartheid planners considering locating “the next Soweto in the Karoo 
and transporting ‘labour’ on a daily base by high-speed train to the then 
Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vaal Triangle industrial and mining core”. At the 
same time, increasingly draconic measures were introduced to destroy 
any black economic endeavour that could compete with white mining, 
farming, manufacturing and retail activities and interests. Again, land 
was paramount in this pursuit, with (1) areas reserved for Black South 
Africans being placed ever-further away (‘in the periphery’) from areas 
of opportunity (‘the core’), (2) large-scale forced removals of Black South 
Africans from where they were trying to access the opportunities offered 
by urban South Africa, or trying to set up businesses in these areas, and 
(3) areas set aside for Black occupation denied of any amenity or 
opportunity for economic activity.
In contrast to the earlier colonial era, national spatial development 
planning became the key means and driver for the creation and 
deepening of the segregated and unequal apartheid state and country:
It was a country solely planned and built for the enjoyment and 
advancement of a small white minority. The black majority, in turn, were 
either (1) temporarily housed in “locations/townships”, or (2) forced to 
stay in ethically-based Bantustans/homelands, and their movement to 
and from these rural areas to urban areas forcefully regulated through 
deeply oppressive measures, including the infamous passbook system. 
Apartheid spatial planning and land allocation was not, as in colonial 
times, a reactive response to land-related crises as and when they arose; 
it was a core component and driver of the creation and organisation of 
the racist social, economic and national spatial development logic of 
the Apartheid State. 
Over time, white South Africans living in towns and cities in Apartheid 
South Africa, simply by owning land, saw their land ‘go’ from ‘land’ to 
‘property’. This occurred through (1) the carefully planned parcelling, 
surveying and registration of such land, (2) the servicing of this land with 
public infrastructure (including social infrastructure such as schools and 
hospitals for whites), and (3) the protection of the value and amenity of 
such ‘properties’ and the suburbs in which they were located through 
town planning legislation and building regulations. Through (1) spatial 
planning and (2) land use control, white South Africans who owned land, 
gained ‘property’, i.e. ‘land with a monetary value and with the potential 
to increase such value’. From this base, white South Africans were able 
to access opportunities in towns and cities, attend well-resourced, good 
schools, and enter the job market in these or similar such places. In doing 
so, reproducing the unjust social, economic and spatial development 
pattern of wealth and privilege developed under the Apartheid system. 
Black South Africans, in turn, who were able to get access to land, or 
retain access to land, were at best left with land that had little value to 
start with and quickly dwindled in value, due to (1) the spatial location of 
such land, and (2) the low spatial quality and lack of complimentary 
land-uses, amenities and economic activities in surrounding areas. It was 
a case of planned, orchestrated and forcefully implemented ‘negative, 
destructive spatial planning’. It actively disempowered Black South 
Africans, making them worse off, and destroyed the attributes and 
potential for any increase in property value that might have accrued to 
them.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 28
This is the dreadful national spatial development pattern that democratic 
South Africa inherited in 1994 – the outcome of more than 300 years of 
unequal spatial investment and planning. It was, however, also the 
spatial platform (1) on which, and (2) from which the country’s space 
economy and society had to be transformed and a new country built.
1.3.2 What have we accomplished and what more needs 
to be done?
Over the past twenty-five years, government has introduced several 
acts, policies and programmes aimed at redressing the spatial legacies 
of colonial and Apartheid rule. In most cases, these were directed at the 
municipal level, with the newly created municipalities expected to pit 
their limited ‘local’ planning and financial powers against the spatial 
legacy of centrally-orchestrated and implemented apartheid spatial 
planning and land-use allocation. In most instances, the impacts were 
minimal. Old patterns were often reinforced, as new developments (such 
as RDP housing) were built in peripheral areas on ‘readily available and 
cheap land’. At the same time, the privileged spaces of Apartheid 
largely remained ‘as is’, with the racial integration that took place, 
focused in former white suburbs and new middle-to-higher income (1) 
extensions to larger towns and cities, and/or (2) gated/barricaded
enclaves primarily in secondary cities and metropolitan areas. 
In the national sphere, the Reconstruction and Development Programme 
Office explored the idea of a National Spatial Development Framework 
(1995-1996). Resistance from national sector departments and provincial 
governments, who did not want their infrastructure investment and 
development spending proposals interfered with, resulted in this plan 
being dropped. Following on from this, the Office of the Deputy President 
(and later the Presidency) introduced the National Spatial Development 
Perspective (NSDP) (2000-2007), which sought to rationalise, harmonise 
and integrate the investment and spending proposals of all government 
sectors and spheres. The NSDP, in turn, was criticised (1) as being “neoliberal, urban-focused and anti-rural”, and (2) of “taking a too narrow a 
view of development potential”. The NSDP was never used as envisaged 
and fell out of favour.
Not much happened in the national planning space after the demise of 
the NSDP until (1) the publication of the Green Paper on National 
Strategic Planning in 2009, (2) the appointment of the first National 
Planning Commission (NPC) in 2010, and (3) the subsequent preparation 
and adoption of the 2030-National Development Plan (NDP) in 2012.
(a) The 2030-National Development Plan (NDP)
The NDP, is an all-encompassing comprehensive national development 
plan that is grounded in:
• The ideals of the Freedom Charter;
• The tenets of the Reconstruction and Development Programme 
(RDP); and
• The principles and directives of our Constitution. 
The NDP (1) speaks to the multitude of needs and challenges facing the 
country, their underlying causes and the factors inhibiting change, and 
(2) provides detailed guidance on responding to all of these. To address 
these challenges, which are all located in the inherited colonial and 
apartheid space economy, the NDP puts forward a series of proposals 
resting on “six pillars”, i.e.:
• Uniting all South Africans around a common programme to 
achieve prosperity and equity;
• Promoting active citizenry to strengthen development, 
democracy and accountability;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 29
• Bringing about faster economic growth, higher investment and 
greater labour absorption;
• Focusing on the key capabilities of people and the state;
• Building a capable and developmental state; and
• Encouraging strong leadership throughout society to work 
together to solve problems.
The NDP recognises that overcoming our triple challenges of inequality, 
unemployment and poverty lies in transforming our physical space. In 
doing so, it recognises that tackling the triple challenges means:
• Fundamentally disrupting and undoing inherited and persisting
(1) colonial and apartheid economic, social and spatial 
investment logics, and (2) their resultant spatial forms and landuse patterns, which in turn impede inclusive economic growth 
and spatial transformation;
• Making radical changes in and to space; and
• Introducing a national inclusionary economic growth and spatial 
transformation-focused investment and spending logic that all 
spheres and sectors of government can (1) buy into, (2) drive 
forward, and (3) be assessed on in terms of the outcomes of their 
actions.
The NDP furthermore recognises that while transformation-focused 
action is required throughout our country, and in every sector and sphere 
of government, it is only through radical and decisive intervention that is 
coherently planned for, and managed at the national scale, that we 
stand a chance at (1) disrupting the Apartheid spatial logic and space 
economy, and (2) overcoming the inequities, isolation, fragmentation
and costly and disruptive travel distances brought about by colonialism 
and Apartheid.
It is especially Chapter 8 of the NDP – “Transforming Human Settlement 
and the National Space Economy” – that makes specific reference to 
the need for a “national spatial development framework”. Such a 
framework, it holds, must optimise, integrate and coordinate the energies 
and economic impacts of the strategic interventions in national space. 
Such ‘national spatial framing’, in turn, is recognised as of crucial 
importance, given the significance of space and access to land in (1) 
bringing about transformation at scale, and (2) ensuring that people and 
places benefit from this intervention. The chapter also includes a 
“proposed national schema for spatial targeting” (see Figure 2) and (1) 
sets out a series of directives for such a framework, and (2) proposes that 
it be provided for in national legislation.
Figure 2: The NDPs Proposed National Schema for Spatial TargetingNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 30
Following on from this guidance, government prepared spatial and landrelated policy and legislation that speaks to, and gives further expression 
to (especially) Chapter 8 of the NDP. These instruments, which cover (1) 
settlement planning, (2) place-making, and (3) land-use and land-use 
management, are the 2016-Integrated Urban Development Framework
(IUDF) and the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013
(SPLUMA).
(b) The Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF)v
The IUDF, South Africa’s national urban policy, takes as one of its key 
drivers the NDPs requirement that South Africa should see meaningful 
and measurable progress in the pursuit of more functionally integrated, 
balanced and vibrant settlements. It builds on, and responds to a variety 
of chapters in the NDP, but notably Chapter 8. This is evident in its guiding 
vision of “liveable, safe, resource-efficient cities and towns that are 
socially integrated, economically inclusive and globally competitive, 
and where residents actively participate in urban life”.
The IUDF puts forward a “new deal” for South Africa’s cities and towns, 
which it sees as being on a continuum, ranging from the very large 
metropolitan regions to the smallest towns in rural South Africa. This new 
deal entails (1) maximising the potential of urban areas, and (2) 
integrating planning, budgeting and investment in such a way that it 
improves and enhances urban form and improves the performance or 
urban areas. The IUDF makes a strong case for:
• Working with and sharing the urban spaces built up during 
colonial and Apartheid times; and 
• ‘Retrofitting’ our urban spaces to optimise their footprint and 
produce compact, coordinated and well-connected cities and 
towns. 
The IUDF puts forward “four strategic goals” for all urban areas, i.e. (1) 
spatial integration, (2) inclusion and access, (3) growth, and (4) 
governance, and proposes “nine policy levers” to achieve these goals. 
These are:
• Integrated urban planning and management;
• Integrated transport and mobility;
• Integrated and sustainable human settlements;
• Integrated urban infrastructure;
• Efficient land governance and management;
• Inclusive economic development;
• Empowered active communities;
• Effective urban governance; and 
• Sustainable finances. 
The IUDF furthermore introduces three “cross-cutting priorities” that are to 
be used in the conceptualisation and implementation of the nine policy 
levers. These are: (1) rural-urban interdependency, (2) urban resilience, 
and (3) urban safety. While making strong, guiding statements in the 
pursuit of shared, inclusive, resilient and liveable urban settlements, the 
IUDF cautions against a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it recognises 
that South Africa has different types of cities and towns that perform 
different roles, and have different requirements. 
The IUDF has a multi-faceted implementation plan, including short-term 
interventions. These require the active participation of a range of 
stakeholders, including all three spheres and sectors of government, the 
private sector, NGOs, NPOs and local community organisations. The IUDF 
is also being used to prepare South Africa’s “Localisation Framework” for 
implementation of the global Urban Agenda – in this way advancing the 
global pursuit of SDG Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlement 
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 31
(c) The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, Act 16 of 
2013 (SPLUMA)
SPLUMA was introduced to “provide a framework for spatial planning 
and land use management” in South Africa. As such, it not only seeks to 
attend to and rectify the fragmented, unequal and unfair apartheid 
planning system inherited from the Apartheid era, but also its 
consequences in space. As in the case of the IUDF, this means the active 
pursuit of (1) spatial transformation and (2) social and economic 
inclusion, to ensure equal access for all to the services, amenities and 
opportunities that well-planned, well-functioning and well-managed
urban and rural settlements offer. Core in this regard is the introduction of 
single, uniform spatial planning and land use management systems in 
municipal areas that include places previously excluded from such 
systems. Being framework legislation, it seeks to provide “principles, 
guidance and norms and standards” for planning in the provincial and 
municipal spheres of government. The five “principles”, which must be 
adhered to, pursued, and observed in all actions undertaken in terms of 
the Act, are “spatial justice, spatial sustainability, efficiency, spatial 
resilience and good administration”.
SPLUMA furthermore:
• Mandates the preparation of “Spatial Development Frameworks”
(SDFs) by all three spheres of government, including the “National 
Spatial Development Framework”;
• Provides for the preparation of “Regional Spatial Development 
Frameworks”; and
• Distinguishes between (1) spatial planning and (2) land use 
management, and establishes a link between the two.
Being located within the Constitutional realm of cooperative 
governance, these frameworks are not positioned in a hierarchical order, 
but instead as interdependent planning instruments that require 
intergovernmental collaboration and integration in their preparation, 
review and implementation. 
(d) Summary
Assessing what has been done and accomplished over the last twentyfour years in terms of the National Transformation Logic (Section 1.2 and
Figure 1), the verdict clearly is that much has been done:
With regards to the national development paradigm, the (1) Constitution 
and (2) Cabinet-adopted NDP provide the foundation, and strategic 
direction for government to respond to our inter-related triple challenges
of inequality, unemployment and poverty. These are supported by a 
series of (1) enabling acts and policies, (2) solid sector plans and 
programmes, and (3) strategic infrastructure investment programmes, 
which include the New Growth Path, the Industrial Policy Framework and 
Industrial Policy Action Plans, the Strategic Integrated Projects, the 
National Transport Master Plan 2050 and a range of national plans for 
human settlement.
With regards to the national spatial development logic, Chapter 8 of the 
NDP, and the IUDF and SPLUMA frame, mandate, allow and guide the 
changes that need to be made in:
• Our space economy, in terms of (1) what we do, where and why, 
(2) which resources we use, and how we use them, and (3) who 
participates in, and benefits and gains from these activities; andNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 32
• Our settlements, in terms of (1) how, and with what outcomes in 
mind, we plan and invest as a country, (2) how and where we 
provide which services, and (3) how we sustain these services. 
This they do by enabling:
• The use of spatial development planning to integrate and 
optimise all public and private sector infrastructure and 
investment spending proposals in space, both (1) in the national 
interest, and (2) to the advantage of local spaces and those who 
live their lives in these spaces; and 
• The radical, decisive and sustainable transformation of our 
settlements into productive, liveable and resilient places for all, 
through (1) wise spatial planning and land-use planning, 
development and management, and (2) the provision of access 
to land, economic opportunities and all the other amenities and 
opportunities that good, quality settlements offer.
However, when considering the national spatial development pattern, 
and the national social and economic interactions, and as echoed in 
numerous government reports, academic papers and the printed and 
social media, despite these components being in place, the stubborn 
persistence of the colonial and Apartheid spatial development patterns
suggests that something is amiss. While much has been done and 
achieved in the ambit of legislation and policy, not that much change 
has been (1) felt in the daily lives of people, or (2) seen on the ground.
Leading on from the National Transformation Logic, as set out in Section 
1.2, it would follow that this ‘change-deficit’ could be due to:
• There being a new national development vision, as provided by 
the NDP, but not a new and/or broadly accepted post-Apartheid 
national spatial development vision;
• The enabling and supporting legislation and policy not being 
adhered to and/or implemented (1) in the way that they are 
meant to be, including not in an integrated, coordinated and 
targeted way, and/or (2) without a collective, national focus on 
the crucial issues of ‘land’ and ‘space’; 
• Not enough time having passed for the necessary transformatory 
changes to have been made in terms of the legal and policy 
framework, and/or their effects to be felt in space (notably in the 
case of the 2013-SPLUMA and the 2016-IUDF); and/or
• The national spatial development logic not having changed from 
its earlier colonial and Apartheid versions, and/or its transition to 
a post-Apartheid national spatial development logic not being 
actively pursued and/or enforced.
Lending from a large evidence base of government reviews, reports, 
assessments and academic papers, notably the recent High-Level Panel 
Review and the 2018-World Bank Report on South Africa, it is argued that 
all of the above explanations are at play. At the same time, another 
possibility is put forward, i.e. that while there is agreement as to what we 
want to move from in terms of past national spatial development 
patterns, there is not clarity and/or agreement as to what the desired 
post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern should look like.
Without such spatial clarity and guidance, public investments are made 
in accordance with (1) sector-driven objectives, targets and outcomes, 
and/or (2) place/territorially-based concerns and challenges, without 
consideration for the national transformative impact.
It is here where the NSDF seeks to intervene…
Given the newness of an intervention like the NSDF for our country, 
international precedent and experience with such national-level 
planning instruments is briefly engaged, before moving on to the NSDF. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 33
1.3.3 International Precedent and Experience
Internationally, national spatial planning with typically a twenty to thirtyyear time horizon, has primarily been a feature of:
• Smaller European countries, notably the Netherlands and 
Denmark, and more recently Ireland, Albania, Serbia, Slovenia, 
Iceland, Estonia, Wales, Scotland, Portugal and Romania;
• Developmental states in Asia, notably China, Singapore, 
Malaysia and South Korea; and
• African countries at two different stages, i.e. (1) shortly after 
independence, and, in more recent times, (2) before or during a 
rapid growth phase as in the case of Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, 
Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana and Tanzania. 
In most cases, such planning is associated with (1) more unitary states 
where the mandate and role of national planning in such arenas is either 
not, or less contested, and (2) countries where such planning is viewed in 
a favourable light due to its link to national economic planning and 
growth, especially the triggering of such growth. The mood of the time 
and the ideological home of the national governing party is also 
important. For example, in times of greater national and/or global 
support for state involvement in the economy, and/or tighter monetary 
conditions, such planning has generally been more welcomed. Likewise, 
the support for spatial planning, and especially national spatial planning, 
has (1) ebbed in accordance with the election of more pro-market, neoliberal parties, and (2) risen with the election of parties that hold a more 
favourable view of state or developmental intervention in the economy.
The mere existence of such national spatial plans, strategies or 
frameworks has not necessarily meant that they (1) were implemented, 
or (2) had the desired impact. In many cases, the notion of one ‘superplan’ imposing itself on the mandates of other sectors in the national tier 
of government and/or in sub-national tiers of government has not been 
welcomed. Furthermore, given that such instruments often have 
coordinating, integrating and guiding functions, and do not have their 
own budgets, they have struggled to secure buy-in and support. In other 
cases, (1) failure to fund, or (2) deliberately withholding funding from the 
entity responsible for the preparation and/or implementation of the 
instrument, for whatever reason, has seen it have little else but a life on 
paper and/or a website. Finally, the power, status and ‘popularity’ of the 
department or entity responsible for the instrument and/or the 
politician(s) responsible for or involved with it, has played an important 
role in its acceptance and use.
Where such instruments have worked, this has in most instances been due 
to:
• The entity preparing it, managing to secure strong support from 
the outset of the preparation process for the instrument both in 
and outside of government;
• Political will, coupled with decisive and capable state action;
• A strong and vocal technical lobby of planners, researchers and 
academics supporting it; and/or
• A clear, tangible need for it, and a prevailing sense amongst the 
population at large that it could make a meaningful difference 
in (1) the fortunes of the country, and (2) their lives. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 34
1.4 The NSDF as Tool for National Spatial 
Development and Transformation
1.4.1 The NSDF’s Mandate
In terms of government policy, Chapter 8 of the NDP calls for the 
preparation of a “national spatial development framework”. In terms of 
legislation, Section 5(3)(a) of SPLUMA provides for, and Sections 13(1) and 
(2) of the Act mandate the Minister to, “… after consultation with other 
organs of state and with the public, compile and publish a national 
spatial development framework” and review it at least once every five 
years.
1.4.2 The NSDF’s Purpose, Focus and Content
Section 13(3) specifies that the National Spatial Development Framework 
(NSDF) must consider:
• All policies, plans and programmes of public and private bodies 
that impact on spatial planning, land development and land use 
management;
• Any matter relevant to the coordination of such policies, plans 
and programmes that impact on spatial planning, land 
development and land use management; and
• All representations submitted to the Minister in respect of the 
framework. 
Section 14 sets out the content of the NSDF, and indicates that the 
framework must:
• Give effect to the development principles and norms and 
standards set out in the Act;
• Give effect to all relevant national policies, priorities, plans and 
legislation;
• Coordinate and integrate provincial and municipal SDFs;
• Enhance spatial coordination and land use management 
activities at national level;
• Indicate desired patterns of land use in the country; and
• Take cognisance of any environmental management instrument 
adopted by the relevant environmental management authority.
Section 12(1), which also deals with the SDFs of provincial governments 
and municipalities, specifies that the NSDF must:
• Interpret and represent the spatial development vision of the 
national sphere of government;
• Be informed by a long-term spatial development vision statement 
and plan;
• Represent the integration and trade-off of all relevant national 
sector policies and plans;
• Guide planning and development across all sectors of the 
national sphere of government;
• Contribute to a coherent, planned approach to spatial 
development in the three spheres of government;
• Provide clear and accessible information to the public and 
private sector, and provide direction for investment purposes;
• Include previously disadvantaged areas, areas under traditional 
leadership, rural areas, informal settlements, slums and 
landholdings of State-Owned Enterprises and government 
agencies, and ensure their inclusion and integration into the 
spatial, economic, social and environmental objectives of the 
national sphere of government;
• Address historical spatial imbalances in development;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 35
• Identify the long-term risks of particular spatial patterns of growth 
and development and the policies and strategies necessary to 
mitigate those risks;
• Provide direction for strategic developments and infrastructure 
investment, promote efficient, sustainable and planned 
investments by all sectors, and indicate priority areas for 
investment in land development;
• Promote a rational and predictable land development 
environment to create trust and stimulate investment;
• Give effect to national legislation and policies on mineral 
resources, and the sustainable utilisation and protection of 
agricultural resources; and
• Consider, and where necessary, incorporate the outcomes of 
substantial public engagement in the framework.
Section 12(2)(a) specifies that the three spheres of government must 
participate in the spatial planning processes that impact on each other,
to ensure that their plans and programmes are coordinated, consistent 
and in harmony with each other. 
Section 12(2)(b) specifies that the NSDF must guide and inform the 
exercise of any discretion of, or any decision taken in terms of the Act, or 
any other law relating to land use and development of land by the 
national sphere of government.
Section 12(3) specifies that the NSDF must contribute to and give spatial 
expression to national development policy and plans, as well as integrate 
and give spatial expression to policies and plans emanating from the 
various sectors of national government, and may include any “Regional 
Spatial Development Framework”.
Section 12(6) specifies that the NSDF must outline specific arrangements 
for prioritising, mobilising, sequencing and implementing public and 
private infrastructural and land development investment in the priority 
spatial structuring areas identified in the framework.
In summary, as indicated in Figure 3 (below), the NSDF must, within the 
broader ‘family’ of strategic and sector plans of government:
• Target and direct all infrastructure investment and development 
spending decisions by all national sector departments and StateOwned Enterprises (SOEs);
• Guide and align plan preparation, budgeting and 
implementation across spheres and between sectors of 
government; and
• Frame and coordinate provincial, regional and municipal spatial 
development frameworks.
1.4.3 The NSDF’s Theory of Change
Based on (1) the National Transformation Logic as set out in Section 1.2, 
(2) the gaps and explanations as identified in the stock-taking exercise in 
Section 1.3, and (3) the legal requirements regarding the NSDF as set out 
Section 1.4.2, the NSDF’s Theory of Change to move our country to the 
desired Post-Apartheid future, is as follows:
• Step 1: The existing national development paradigm, including 
the Constitution, the NDP and the existing legal and policy 
framework, notably SPLUMA and the IUDF, is used to:
o Articulate a compelling and persuasive post-Apartheid 
spatial development logic and identify the ‘shifts’ from the 
old and existing logics that this new logic requires; and
o Craft a strong and credible post-Apartheid national 
spatial development vision;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 36
• Step 2: The new logic and vision is used together with an analysis 
of the current and unfolding ‘national spatial development 
landscape’, to develop a set of national spatial development 
levers, and craft a desired post-Apartheid national spatial 
development pattern;
• Step 3: The post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern
is used to indicate what actions, interventions and priority actions 
are required to ensure transition to this desired pattern; 
• Step 4: The post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern
and interventions and priority actions are used to prepare clear 
implementation guidance for realising the desired national 
spatial transformation; and
• Step 5: The spatial development guidance, tasks and actions as 
set out in the NSDF are implemented, and (1) movement towards 
the realisation of the desired post-Apartheid national spatial 
development pattern monitored and assessed, and (2) corrective 
measures taken as and where required.
The outputs of these steps provide the structure for this document, as set 
out in Section 1.5.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 37

PART TWO: The Draft NSDF Preparation ProcessNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 40
2.1 Introduction
The process of preparing the first NSDF for South Africa started in April 
2014. The formulation of the Draft NSDF comprised Phases 3 and 4 of the 
process, as indicated in Figure 5. 
Figure 5:: NSDF Preparation Process
2.2 Preparatory Work and Research Phase
The first two phases of the NSDF compilation process started with the 
preparation of the “NSDF Concept Document” by the Department of 
Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), which set the parameters 
for the remainder of the process. This was followed by an intensive 
process of research into thematic areas that (1) influence, and (2) are 
influenced by, the spatial legacies and dynamics of the South African 
landscape. The Thematic Research Reports provided the basic 
diagnostic for the NSDF, and focused on:
• Population dynamics, migration and people; 
• Human settlements; 
• Social infrastructure; 
• Natural resources and the environment; 
• Movement and transport; 
• The national space economy; and
• Unemployment, labour, education and skills development, with 
an emphasis on rural development, land reform and agriculture.
At the outset of the NSDF process, the NSDF Technical Working Group 
(TWG) was established as a multi-stakeholder forum including
representatives from (1) national sector departments, (2) Offices of the 
Premier and provincial sector departments involved in planning, (3) SOEs,
and (4) relevant government agencies and organisations.
2.3 Spatial Analysis and Proposals Phase
The third phase of the process, i.e. Spatial Analysis and Proposals, was 
conducted in a series of work-streams, as follows:
2.3.1 Foundational Work 
The focus of this work-stream was to (1) establish the most significant 
global, national and inter-regional spatial development opportunities 
and challenges, and (2) develop a draft national spatial vision and set of 
national spatial development levers. Foundational work was also done 
for the Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)-process.
Engagements in this phase included (1) NSDF Steering Committee 
meetings, (2) introductory presentations to the NSDF TWG, (3) expert 
inputs, (4) bilateral meetings with selected sector departments, and (5) 
an online survey conducted with planning professionals.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 41
2.3.2 Preliminary Sharing and Testing
The focus of this work-stream was on sharing and testing (1) the list of 
national opportunities and challenges, and (2) the draft proposals 
prepared in the Foundational work-stream. With this objective in mind, a
‘Consolidated Draft Discussion Document’ was compiled, to enable (1) 
a focused discussion with, and (2) the sourcing of inputs, comments and 
proposals from national and provincial government departments, 
municipalities, SOEs, the NPC, the South African Local Government 
Association (SALGA) and stakeholder organisations, such as the South 
African Cities Network (SACN). Work-sessions were also held with the 
NSDF TWG and provincial officials responsible for the preparation and 
review of PSDFs, and submissions made to the NPC.
2.4 Draft NSDF Phase
This phase entailed (1) the preparation of the ‘first Draft NSDF’ based on 
the outputs of the previous work-streams and the inputs, comments and 
proposal made during these phases, and (2) structured engagement on
the Draft NSDF, as provided for in SPLUMA (see Figure 6). These 
engagements included: 
• A presentation to the NPC;
• A presentation to, and work session with the TWG;
• Provincial workshops in all nine provinces involving stakeholders 
from municipalities, provincial departments and the private 
sector; and
• Bilateral engagements with national sector departments.
The Draft NSDF was revised and amended based on (1) further datagathering and analyses, and (2) inputs and comments made during the 
engagement sessions, and written submissions received after the events. 
It is envisaged that this ‘new Draft NSDF’ will be engaged both further 
and wider, and include the ‘sixty-day public commenting period’, as 
prescribed in Section 13(4)(b) of SPLUMA. 
2.5 Cabinet Submission Phase
The final phase will entail the preparation of (1) the ‘Final Draft NSDF’ for 
Cabinet Submission, taking cognisance of public comments and inputs,
and (2) the documentation, as required in terms of the SEIAS-process.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 42

PART THREE: National Spatial Development Shapers Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 44
3.1 Introduction
A wide and diverse range of (1) national spatial development realities 
and (2) international, national and sub-national trends, flows and 
patterns impact upon, and shape both the national development 
landscape, and our ability to realise our national development goals. 
Part Three of the NSDF provides some insights into these inter-related 
national spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities. It 
draws on, and highlights aspects as raised in and by:
• An extensive diagnostic conducted in the earlier stages of the 
preparation of the NSDF, and captured in a ‘Consolidated 
Research Report’ (see Section 2.2); 
• Supra-national, national and provincial development plans, 
policies, frameworks and overviews; 
• National discourses, newspaper reports, books and book 
chapters, journal and magazine articles, and published and 
unpublished research reports; and
• Modelled spatial implications of a series of population growth 
and climate change scenarios. 
The NDP objectives, SPLUMA principles and NSDF vision statement were 
used in an iterative way as lens to (1) ‘read’ the South African national 
spatial development and planning landscape, and (2) identify key 
national spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities. 
From this analysis, ten ‘shapers’ of national spatial settlement and 
development were put together. These shapers are discussed in Sections 
3.2 to 3.12 below. In each case, the scale and extent of ‘the shaper’, and 
its implications for (1) national space, (2) the national space economy 
and/or (3) national spatial governance are highlighted, and connections 
to other shapers highlighted. Interspersed between the ten shapers are a 
series of thematically-structured ‘Info Charts’ under the following themes:
• People and Places;
• Ecologies, Economies and Spaces;
• Institutions and Services; and
• Movements, Connections and Flows 
These charts capture and present in visual form key information pieces 
and elements, as referred to under the shapers. The section is concluded 
with a summary (see Section 3.12) of the most significant national spatial 
development challenges and opportunities extracted from the ten
shapers.
3.2 Demographic Shifts, Dividends, Vulnerabilities 
and Diversity
In the next 31 years, the South African population will grow by at least 
another 17 million people, from around 58 million people in 2018, to 
around 75 million by 2050. In addition to a population that will be 30% 
larger than we currently have, it is anticipated that (1) it will primarily be 
an urban-based population, and (2) at least 30 million of the 75 million 
South Africans (40%) are likely to be living below the Minimum Living Level 
(MLL).
In terms of composition, the very youthful South African population of 
today (28% of the population is below 15 years of age) will by 2050 still be 
regarded as young, with 25% of the population below 15 years of age,
and 31% between 15 and 34 years of age, and in their primary 
childbearing years. The share of the population that will be ‘65 years of 
age and older’ will also have experienced significant growth, by 2050 
constituting 8% of the population, i.e. 6 million people, which is nearly Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 45
double the 3.2 million people that were ‘65 years of age and older’ in 
2018. This group will require increasingly more health and frail care and 
income support from households, communities and the State. This will of 
course open up and create a large number of job opportunities for frail 
and health care workers, many of which may be created in rural areas, 
if this is where, as anticipated, most of those above 65 years of age will 
choose to live.
Given that the bulk of the envisaged youthful population will be living in 
urban areas, it will potentially present the country with a ‘dynamic-tripledividend’: (1) a large, dynamic, creative and innovative economically 
active population living at high densities in a few large places, 
constituting (2) a large, densely connected consumer market for goods 
and services, and (3) a far more accepting and accommodating 
approach to difference and diversity, which will be especially important 
in the large urban conurbations of the future. It is especially the higher 
densities at which our people will be living, coupled with the greater 
need to co-produce and collaborate in such spaces, that may create 
and instil a different view of each other – more accepting and more 
celebratory of difference, and more mindful of the contribution that 
different individuals and groups can make to resolving a challenge or 
problem in an innovative and sustainable way. 
This ‘dynamic-triple-dividend’ is, however, not a given, and may not 
materialise, in which case our youth could become a very volatile and 
destructive force. Should this youthful population (1) be raised in a caring 
environment with adequate food, love and care, (2) be well-educated 
and (3) be well-integrated in society, the ‘full’ dividend is more likely to 
materialise. Should the opposite prevail, as is currently the case for large 
numbers of our youth growing up in deeply impoverished rural areas and 
townships, only parts of the dividend, or none of it at all will be realised, 
with severely negative consequences. As for the greater acceptance of 
difference and diversity, should (1) scarcity, and (2) an unwillingness to 
share the little that is available prevail, this dividend will also not 
materialise. In such an event, our urban areas could very likely see more 
of the xenophobia and other forms of hatred of ‘those who are seen to 
be different’, and this will be to the detriment of our cities transitioning 
into dynamic cosmopolitan economic powerhouses.
Merely hoping that the dynamic-triple-dividend will materialise by itself, 
especially given our historically high levels of poverty and inequality, is 
not a sensible strategy. To realise the ‘full’ dividend will require that it be 
actively pursued, with the State playing a critical role in this regard. 
Support for nutrition programmes, housing, care and access to 
economic opportunities for our youth will need to be attended to. All 
State plans will also need to be prepared with an emphasis on youth and 
diversity. At the same time, those national spatial development patterns 
and settlement forms that will be better at (1) eliciting the dividend and 
(2) allowing it to flourish, will need to be pursued. These include (1) 
developing urban settlements at higher densities, (2) greater mixing of 
land-uses, and (3) greater accessibility to the services that successful, 
well-connected, dynamic urban areas offer.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 46

3.3 Urbanisation, the Pursuit of a Better Life and a 
Desire for Quality Urban Living and Spaces
Urbanisation, meaning both (1) the movement of our people from rural 
to urban areas, and (2) the increase in the percentage of our population 
living in urban areas, will continue unabatedly throughout the three 
decades up to 2050. According to United Nations-estimates, “… 71.3% of 
the South African population will live in urban areas by 2030, reaching 
nearly 80% by 2050.” National population projections for medium and 
high-growth scenarios (considering population growth as well as 
international migration patterns) conducted to explore future climate 
change scenarios, illustrate the need to plan for at least a 30% increase 
in our urban population by 2050vi. In the same vein, the CSIR’s
‘Downscaled Settlement Locational Modelling-exercise’ projects that 
under ‘a scenario with no radical intervention’, approximately 85% of 
South Africa’s population will be living in urban agglomerations by 2050. 
Our three urban regions (Gauteng, Western Cape and eThekwini) will 
experience the largest increases in population – this being from natural 
growth, as well as in-migration from South Africa, SADC and further afield.
Significant movement will also take place from villages and small towns 
to larger, better connected towns located on major transport routes
where provision of better and more reliable basic services, education, 
healthcare and policing are, and will remain, important drivers of 
migration. However, while small towns and dense rural settlements are 
not expected to see a large population growth, they are also not 
expected to see a significant population decline in either the mediumscale or high-growth scenarios for population growth in South Africa. As 
such, both large urban regions and rural areas will require targeted and 
appropriate government focus and attention.
Given the presence of a young, educated, vocal and demanding urban 
electorate of around 65 million people by 2050, making good on the 
promise of a better life for all, will be a major concern for government. 
This will especially be the case in large urban regions, where these large 
populations will place huge demands on already over-burdened, 
collapsing and ageing municipal infrastructure. At the same time, these 
areas will need to rapidly increase their contribution to the country’s 
formal economic output and tax income, and become (1) the sites of 
‘spatial transformation’ and ‘drivers of inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth’ at scale, and (2) the incubators of dynamic, creative, 
and innovative new economies. Municipalities will not be able to carry 
this burden alone and will require significant financial and technical 
support from (1) national and provincial government, and (2) the private 
sector. Long-term planning for urban growth, including the identification 
of suitable land, land reform planning, land-use management, and the 
preparation of infrastructure master plans with full life-cycle costing, will 
be imperative.
Ways of urban life and living are also likely to undergo radical change, 
with urban inhabitants increasingly (1) seeking, finding and making ways 
of making a life for themselves, and (2) becoming far more involved in 
making better quality urban spaces in what will for most be their only 
home. This ‘drive from below’ will be fuelled by (1) a far more active 
citizenry, in part driven by necessity, (2) a much smaller ‘large-sized 
private sector’, severely bruised by dwindling disposable household 
incomes and a slow-to-change capital-intensive business model unsuited 
to an increasingly-faster changing business environment, and (3) the 
scale of the challenge in relation to the State’s finances and capacity to 
deliver services and assist in this regard. This ‘drive from below’ will also 
lead to a relaxation of bylaws and (1) far less petty and far more highlevel land use regulations, enabling far greater levels of economic 
activity and agility, and far more organic and inclusive economic 
growth, (2) far greater diversity in economic activities, housing forms and 
tenure types, (3) far more horizontal and vertical mixing of land uses, (4) 
far higher settlement densities, and (5) far more vibrant and lively city 
streets. Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 52
The gaps in State service provision will very likely open up opportunities 
for entrepreneurial endeavour, notably in the provision of housing, water, 
energy, health care and education. The greater availability of urban 
land for settlement, through urban land reform, will also see a rapid 
increase in the number of new small-scale property developers. 
Altogether, these new forms of urban living and urban spaces will 
become the new drivers of innovation, creativity and job creation and 
societal transformation from below and cement large urban areas as the 
most important contributors to the South African economy. This will not 
only be done through the collective endeavours of millions of individual 
actors and small and micro-sized enterprises in the economy, but also by 
the contribution of innovative and agile large companies competing
successfully in the global economy.
An increase in cross-border trade and the rendering of personal, 
financial, education and health services in border-region towns, will see 
an increase in movement by South Africans and citizens from other 
African countries, to such towns. Given the envisaged changes in urban 
areas towards places of far greater vibrancy, diversity and respect for 
difference, and their global connectivity, the larger urban areas will 
experience significant in-migration of people from primarily other African 
countries, but also from further afield. 
In the sprawling, dense rural areas along (1) the eastern escarpment of 
the country in Limpopo and Mpumalanga, (2) the eastern KwaZulu-Natal 
and Eastern Cape coastal strip, and (3) the north-western mining and 
agricultural region running from the Northwest to the Northern Cape, the 
trend towards far greater densification in nodes and along routes 
connecting such nodes, will continue and result in far more concentrated 
development and the release of agricultural land for productive use in 
these areas.
Smaller towns in rural areas will also experience sizeable counterurbanisation, as growing numbers of retiring middle-income South 
Africans from urban areas will settle for more tranquil lives in the rural parts
of our country. This will, in many such settlements, facilitate (1) the 
construction and upgrading of houses by individuals and families for this 
anticipated retirement stage, as well as (2) the tailor-made development 
of housing units catering for this older population in such towns, which will 
support the growth of a new generation of small-to-medium sized 
property developers in these towns. The injection of the regular pensions 
of these new, retired inhabitants will also (1) stimulate the local economy, 
by creating a new market for local produce and personal and social 
services, notably the provision of health and frail care services, and (2) 
provide valuable and stable municipal rates and tax incomes. This move
to rural South Africa will also be strengthened and facilitated in many 
villages and smaller towns by the rapid release of land in such towns 
through the national land reform programme. 
Quality urban living in both urban and rural areas will require just and 
sustainable access to social services. The provision of such services (1) 
requires investment in ‘social infrastructure’, i.e. ‘high-quality facilities that 
are well-equipped, maintained and operated, and staffed to the correct 
level by well-trained personnel who provide a range of critical social 
services to the community’, and (2) include the full spectrum of health 
and education services, citizen registration, welfare support, cultural and 
sport and recreational facilities. While no comprehensive overview of 
backlogs in the provision of these services is available at national level, 
local case-studies show critical shortages and grossly inadequate service 
delivery in both rural and urban areas. These include (1) poor 
maintenance of buildings, (2) a shortage of equipment, and (3) critical 
staff shortages, especially with respect to well-trained and dedicated 
staff. The projected national population increase to 75 million people by 
2050, however, not only means expanded requirements for social facility 
investment and operation, but also (1) presents an opportunity for 
meaningful employment in rural towns, and (2) if properly planned and 
provided, can act as a highly effective and sustainable economic 
multiplier. The importance of spatial planning to guide targeted social 
infrastructure investment can, however, not be over-emphasised –
establishing a sound spatial-location-logic that optimises human capital Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 53
development with economic impact, is imperative to address inequality 
and ensure inter-generational justice.
3.4 Ruralisation and the Need for Decisive and 
Sustainable Rural Development and Agrarian 
Reform
Currently more than 17 million of our people are estimated to be living in 
rural settlements across dense and sparsely populated regions – mainly 
in the former Bantustans. Most of these people live in conditions of severe 
poverty and vulnerability. Research on these conditions shows that ‘… 
the deprivation gap between those living in the former homelands and 
the rest of the country has not narrowed in the period between 2001 and 
2011’, meaning that well-intended investment and rural development 
initiatives for over a decade or more have not significantly changed this 
picture of relative deprivation in these areasvii.
However, after (1) hundreds of years of colonial and Apartheid
oppression, exploitation, disregard and calculated under-investment, (2) 
followed by decades of uncoordinated and fragmented investment by 
successive post-Apartheid governments in rural South Africa, these areas 
are finally getting the recognition, respect and focused ‘development 
attention’ they deserve and have been promised since 1994. This trend 
towards taking rural areas seriously is set to continue and become 
stronger over the next three decades, as rural areas become recognised 
as parts of our country that are (1) areas of national significance for 
surface water and food production and the provision of key national 
ecosystem services, (2) still ‘home’ to millions of South Africans, many of 
them highly vulnerable and isolated from the broader national economy, 
(3) places of retreat, rest and connection with nature and cultural 
practices, far away from fast-paced urban lives, and (4) sought-after 
domestic and international tourism and retirement destinations. In terms 
of State action, focused rural development is set to find expression in (1) 
targeted agrarian reform, (2) tenure reform, (3) the development of agriprocessing and logistic support-hubs, (4) diversification of the local 
economy, (5) small-town redevelopment and regeneration in accessible 
locations, (6) public works-led job creation programmes and the roll-out 
of core government social and municipal services, and (7) the provision 
of grant support with the building and upgrading of housing, specifically 
in identified regional development anchors and rural service towns. 
Of crucial importance to the realisation of the desired rural development 
objectives is rural land reform, which will release vast amounts of underutilised commercial agricultural and State-owned land for use by new 
entrants to the farming sector, and give the resurgence and upliftment 
of rural areas a huge impetus. The new rural economy will, however, 
necessitate the development of a very different local economy in those 
towns built up over generations and sustained by a model of either largescale commercial agriculture or subsistence agriculture. New agriculture
support entities, cooperatives, equipment, fertilizer, market support, 
funding and research will need to be introduced in towns in rural areas 
to support a new type of farmer. Municipalities, who will have to ensure 
new and appropriate land management in such areas, may also be 
expected and/or called upon to assist new role-players in the local 
economy with establishing new agricultural and non-agricultural-related 
economic activities. In this, they will require very specific support from the 
national and provincial sector departments responsible for agriculture
and rural development, who will themselves also have to take on new 
roles in the light of the new dawn in rural South Africa. 
Rural communities will increasingly also demand better levels and higher 
speeds of connectivity, both by road and rail, and by broadband. At the 
same time, demands will be placed on government for the provision of 
quality social, education, health and police services, placing significant 
pressure on what will, for at least the next decade, be a severely Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 54
constrained fiscus. As alluded to earlier, it is imperative that such services 
be provided in such places and in such a manner that they (1) have the 
greatest impact, and (2) are able to service the greatest number of 
inhabitants. In deciding on sites/locations and service-mixes, the focus
should be on serving (1) the youth, and (2) those inhabitants who will 
elect to retire in rural areas, and who will spend significant amounts of 
money during their working lives on building and/or maintaining their 
retirement homes.
3.5 Natural Resource Limitations, a Move Away 
from Ecosystem Destruction, Pollution and a 
National Water Security Crisis 
Over the last few years, the majority of ordinary South Africans citizens 
were rudely awakened to the reality that South Africa is a water-scarce 
country, and not one merely struck or frustrated by occasional droughts. 
While we have for many years been able to transfer water between 
catchments with a surplus to areas with a deficit, and maintained the 
myth of water-abundance, the reality is that the model has run its course 
and that we no longer have sufficient water left in the system to 
redistribute if we continue to use water as we did in the past. We will have 
to employ technology to (1) supplement our water supply, (2) reduce our 
use, and (3) better manage and distribute piped water.
Should we, however, choose to continue along the economic trajectory 
that disregards our natural base, and continues to incur huge damage 
to our natural resources, we will in the very near future become even 
more aware of, and be confronted with the following realities: (1)
dwindling water security and availability, wetland destruction, severely 
disrupted water catchments and over-utilised and polluted groundwater 
sources, especially in our mining and commercial agricultural 
productions areas; (2) highly contaminated and toxic waterbodies and 
waterways; (3) toxic levels of air pollution through highly noxious industrial 
activities and the generation of energy through coal-fired power stations;
(4) the loss of the very small extent of high-value agricultural land we 
once had; (5) irreparably damaged ecosystems and loss of the services 
they provide for all forms of life; and (6) a long and rapidly growing list of 
extinct species. Furthermore, we will be confronted with the reality that 
our continued pollution of rivers and streams, soil, air and the oceans 
around us, is not compatible with our plans to (1) grow our tourism sector, 
(2) expand our agricultural and agro-processing activities, and (3) make 
far greater use of the oceans economy. As a country, we will be asked 
to make hard choices, such as between (1) an environment that sustains 
us and is not harmful to our lives, and (2) the economic activities and 
national income that comes from exporting and burning dirty carbons, 
like coal, and irresponsible, callous and wasteful resource use.
Turning away from this looming ecological disaster will require that tradeoffs be made at the national level between (1) noxious and polluting
economic activities, and (2) ecosystem health and integrity. At the same 
time, water demand management, and the behavioural changes and 
enforcement protocols that emanate from this, will need to be 
introduced, policed and enforced at municipal level. Irreplaceable 
natural resources of national significance, irrespective of where they are
located, will need to be acknowledged, demarcated and treated as 
such, so that they can contribute to the well-being of all citizens.
Municipalities will have to focus far more so in their land use 
management functions on protecting such areas, and promote 
compatible and productive uses that contribute to environmental 
management and restoration goals.
Likewise, sustainable land development and intergenerational spatial 
justice will require effective land administration and management, civil 
society custodianship and strong and efficient governance. This will only 
be possible if (1) municipal land use management systems are in place, Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 55
and (2) municipalities are staffed with competent, dedicated and caring 
town planning officials and councillors, who cannot be corrupted and 
who have the will and mandate to act. In addition to this, rehabilitation 
of degraded land in stressed and degraded catchments (including 
former mining areas) will need to be done. Mining companies must be 
held accountable to clean up what they polluted, and regulations in this 
regard rigorously enforced. Mediation of the fall-out in terms of jobs tied 
to polluting mining and industrial activities that are distractive of the 
ecosystem will have to be done, and job creation in ecologically lessdamaging sectors (1) planned for well in advance of mine closures, and 
(2) actively and adequately provided for. 
3.6 Climate Change Implications, Regional 
Adaptation and Mitigation
Climate change is set to have far-reaching impacts on our country, 
notably with regards to temperature and rainfall patterns. Temperatures 
are set to increase by between 1 and 4 degrees Celsius between now 
and 2050, in primarily the western and north-western parts of the country,
while the number of very warm days is set to increase in an equally wide 
band across the country. Rainfall is set to decrease in a large stretch of 
the south-western, western and north-western parts of the country, while 
rainfall is set to increase, but also become more erratic in the central and 
south-eastern part of the country. These climatic changes will not only 
have severely detrimental impacts on the highly productive agricultural 
activities in the western and north-western parts of the country. The towns 
in these areas, of which most rely heavily on these agricultural 
economies, will be equally hard-hit, and their residents required to make 
far less use of water for domestic and economic consumption to keep 
the agricultural activities going. 
Climate change impacts will also render significant parts of the country 
increasingly hostile to human, animal and plant life, and hard to live in. In 
addition to this, the likelihood of more veldfires is set to increase, 
especially so in vast and remote rural areas where municipal services are 
already thinly spread, and the State’s capacity to deal with such disasters
is generally weak. While some of the central and eastern parts of the 
country may experience more rain, the equally greater degree of 
uncertainty and intensity of the precipitation will not be conducive to 
traditional conventional agriculture. Sudden downpours may lead to (1) 
a greater loss of top soil, and silting up of dams and water canals, and 
(2) the destruction of rural roads and infrastructure. In urban areas, such 
sudden and severe downpours could lead to flash-flooding, loss of life 
and destruction of municipal infrastructure, buildings and property, 
especially so in cases where these are not well-maintained. In many of 
our urban areas, it is especially the poor, vulnerable and marginalised 
inhabitants who live in poor housing that is not well-located, and who are 
generally not insured, that will disproportionally suffer the impacts of such 
disasters. 
In terms of national land use and settlement patterns, climate change 
begs serious questions with regards to future human settlement in 
national space, such as: How will climatic change impact regional 
development patterns in terms of temperature, liveability, water, food 
security and the adaptation to viable agricultural practices and 
commodities? What kind of impacts can be expected in settlements and 
where should new cities be built, and with what population-size in mind?
What are the disaster-risk reduction interventions, coping-capacity and 
national resource implications, e.g. drought relief, that are required in 
areas that are set to experience significant and intolerable changes in 
climate: Should high-risk settlement development for instance be 
curbed, will government be able to provide support for the most 
vulnerable and if so, of what kind and at what cost? Furthermore, what 
kind of activities and settlement patterns should be allowed in such Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 56
areas, and should new settlement development in these areas be 
discouraged, or concentrated in alternative, carefully selected suitable 
locations? Questions around regional adaptation includes consideration 
whether directing or discouraging urban and settlement in certain 
regions is 
constitutional, and if so, what kind of method or measure to 
regulate settlement in such areas 
would be used? 
The higher levels of discomfort in the interior of the western and north
-
western parts of the country may also trigger migration from these parts 
to areas with better climates
, notably the (1) eastern interior and (2) 
eastern and southern coastal belt
s. The eastern coastal belt and eastern 
escarpment is, however, the 
part of the country (1) most suitable for food 
production and surface water
-capture, and (2) in which traditional land 
tenure systems currently prevail. These are also areas in which the 
dreaded land
-related legislation of the colonial and Apartheid eras have 
left deep scars, both on the people, and space
, in the form of limited 
access to land, over
-grazing and erosion. Given the urgency of the 
matter from a national perspective, and the challenges that will be 
encountered, it is of crucial importance that 
‘a national spatial climate
-
mitigation plan’ be prepared, with (1) participation of all role
-players 
involved, and (2) strong spatial planning, ecosystems and land
-use 
management component
s
.
In addition to this, climate change is also set to have severely negative 
impacts in terms of temperature increases and lower rainfall figures in 
countries to the north of South Africa, and up into central Africa. These 
changes could potentially lead to large
-scale in
-migration of 
‘environmental refugees’ from such countries to amongst others, South 
Africa. Thus
,
South Africa will both (1) need to be prepared
, and (2) our 
national space be planned with such eventualities in mind, to avoid the 
kind of antagonism and open hostility that refugees from Africa, the 
Middle East and Asia are increasingly experiencing in parts of Europe.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 57

3.7 Land Reform
Irrespective of the final wording of the amendment to Section 25 of the 
Constitution specifying the conditions in terms of which the State may 
expropriate land without compensation, land reform will see a rapid 
expansion from its current form and its performance to date, both in 
urban and rural South Africa. In accordance with the intention to address 
colonial land and livelihood dispossession and injustice, Black South 
Africans will either get (1) secure tenure and land use rights, or (2) full title 
to land, and the grossly unbalanced land ownership profile, by which the 
bulk of commercial agricultural land in the country is held by White South 
Africans, will be radically reversed. As such, land reform is set to have a 
huge impact on (1) national land-use and land-ownership patterns, (2) 
national settlement development, and (3) the national space economy.
In urban areas, land reform is sure to involve the identification of ‘suitable 
land for making a life, and quality urban life and living’, i.e. land that 
could (1) ensure infill development, (2) bring about greater social and 
economic inclusion, (3) unleash new economic opportunities, and (4) 
enable a far greater segment of the South African population to own
and lease property, and have access to the amenities and qualities of 
urban living. In addition to this, the provision of land for economic 
activities and property development in urban areas to Black South 
Africans previously excluded from such opportunities, will also assist in 
bringing far more new and emerging actors into the economy, and assist 
in breaking the back of the deeply monopolistic, concentrated and elitecontrolled nature of the South African economy. At the same time, urban 
land reform may assist in making available sites for (1) unleashing new 
opportunities in under-valued economies in our urban areas, such as the 
optimisation of the cultural industries, entertainment, food preparation, 
and service and small-scale manufacturing and repair activities, and (2) 
facilitating the functional integration of urban South Africa into a 
functional national economic innovation, inclusion and transformation 
system. This will, however, require of municipalities to gather the 
necessary information and keep up-to-date records of all land parcels in 
their areas of jurisdiction that are (1) strategically located with regards to 
urban economies, (2) underutilised, (3) vacant, and/or (4) kept for 
speculative purposes only. It would also require decisive action and the 
limiting of time-lags between land acquisition, release, development and 
utilisation. 
In rural areas, information such as (1) land ownership, (2) the condition of 
the land and soils, (3) the carrying capacity of the land, (4) the availability 
of water on the land, (5) accessibility, (6) the quality of fences and roads, 
and (7) anticipated exposure to climate change, would be important 
considerations. As in urban areas, limiting the time lag between land 
acquisition and utilisation will be of the essence. Care would also need 
to be taken to mediate the impacts of changes in rural economies, 
notably in small towns built up on the back of, and reliant on (1) largescale commercial agriculture and large farmers, and (2) their related 
market, financial and personal services, daily supplies, education, health 
care and fertilizer needs. At the same time, engagement will need to 
take place on the matter of tenure in communal land-areas, and the 
utilisation and sharing of such land in the ‘ecological sweet spot’ of our 
country, i.e. the eastern coastal belt and eastern escarpment, for food 
production, surface water capture and provision of key ecosystem 
services.
3.8 Dependency on Natural Resource Extraction 
and Related Economic Activities
Currently, our national economy is heavily natural resource-extraction 
based, with mining and coal-based energy generation key contributors 
to our national GVA. The NDP supports a move away from coal-based 
energy generation in line with international trends and climate protocols. 
Long-term spatial and infrastructure planning must be cognisant of this Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 66
move, and a collectively and carefully planned, well-communicated 
and stakeholder-sensitive transition – including the social, spatial and 
economic mitigation of the sure-to-be-significant impacts of the move –
be undertaken.
While currently still of enormous importance, mining is set to shrink in terms 
of its contribution to the national economy, and undergo a radical 
change in terms of employment levels in the light of automation and 
possible disruptions in the demand for certain commodities, such as coal 
and platinum. The move away from platinum is tied to (1) an increased 
search for and use of cheaper alternatives, (2) far more recycling of the 
metal, and (3) most importantly, the global move away from diesel cars, 
of which most use platinum in their catalytic converters. While (1) the use 
of palladium – another member of the Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) –
in the catalytic converters of petrol cars (following on from the turn away 
from diesel) may offer some short-term respite, and (2) the use of 
platinum in the hydrogen fuel cell-industry may hold out some longerterm hope, there is a very real likelihood of the PGMs industry seeing 
serious shrinkage in the not too distant future. Should this happen, it would 
hit our economy very hard in at least three ways: (1) a much smaller 
demand for platinum, which could lead to en masse platinum mine 
closures and job losses; (2) a greatly reduced demand for dieselpowered vehicles, which could hurt our local car manufacturing industry 
(with its strong emphasis on diesel cars) severely; and (3) a greater 
demand for electric cars in which we have not invested as a country, 
coupled with a focus in new mining exploration-activities on metals 
required for electrical cars, which we are not world-leaders in.
Areas where the coal and platinum mining sectors form the backbone of 
the local economy, especially insofar as local employment is concerned, 
will have to be supported to transition towards more diversified, 
sustainable economies. In places where (1) climate change, and (2) the 
lack of, or limited number of opportunities mean that there are no viable 
economic alternatives to mining, resettlement to places with viable, 
sustainable economies will need to be (1) planned for with the full 
participation of all stakeholders, and (2) effected with the utmost degree 
of circumspection. 
3.9 Technology, Innovation, Resilience and 
Disruptions in the Space Economy 
While this is a fertile field for speculation, there is far less clarity as to what 
this shaper will entail and how it will play out in countries, cities and rural 
areas throughout the world. What is increasingly clear is that (1) 
communication will become faster, more affordable and more 
accessible to all; (2) urban areas, notably large urban areas, with their 
potential for human-to-human service-based economies, dense 
institutional networks and higher education, innovation and research 
centres and institutes, will remain, and become even more significant 
players in this/the new economy; (3) automation, robotics, and machine 
learning is upon us, and will cause major disruptions in the world of work 
and will leave very few occupations unaffected, with some areas of 
work, such as dangerous and physically draining work in the mining 
industry at least being a thing of the past; and (4) those who have higher 
levels of education are more likely to manage, utilise and gain from the 
transitions than those with only rudimentary levels. 
With regards to national spatial development, South Africa should see (1) 
the roll-out of lightning-fast broadband access throughout the country 
within less than a decade, (2) the advent of highly automated mining 
activities with far fewer on-site jobs, which can be sustained by “fly-in-flyout” modes of operation, and hence not require the establishment of 
‘mining towns’ as in the past, (3) automation in economic sectors that 
are currently regarded as major creators of employment, such as 
manufacturing and agriculture, thus leading to a reduction in Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 67
employment and job creation in areas where it would be sorely needed, 
notably rural South Africa, and (4) closures of factories and mines in South 
Africa that are unable to compete globally, leading not only to job losses
in towns dependent on those sectors, but also a general contraction in 
retail and economic activities in affected municipalities.
In order to ensure that the country is not left behind, the following are 
imperative: (1) the roll-out of broadband throughout the country, first to 
the most densely populated areas, and thereafter the more sparsely 
populated areas; (2) the prioritisation of well-functioning, key national 
road and rail networks to ensure the creation of a densely integrated 
functional national economic system; (3) a focus on innovation and 
knowledge generation, codification, packaging and sale; (4) the 
expansion, modernisation and re-gearing of the higher education sector
towards growing and supporting innovation and the entertainment, 
cultural and creative industries; and (5) the nurturing of all South Africans, 
but especially our youth, by ensuring proper nutrition, a safe, secure and 
pollution-free environment, quality health care and meaningful, life-long
learning, to ensure that they are, and remain fully prepared for the 
dynamic world they will be living in. In addition to that, if well-used, the
new technologies, given their (1) ease of access, and (2) disruptive 
qualities, should be of assistance in breaking down the monopolistic 
nature of the South African economy.
For urban areas to play the role that they can and must, ‘public city 
space’ will have to be optimised in terms of its ability to attract and grow 
informal activities linked to information, communication and technology 
services. This will in itself ask (1) less of a focus in urban economic and 
spatial development plans on large-scale ‘nodal developments’ with 
flashy high-rental shopping malls and office blocks, and warehouses filled 
with imported goods, and (2) more on new technology-assisted and 
enabled, small-and-medium-sized eco-agro-industries, manufacturing 
and cultural activities, and innovation. Should South Africa not succeed 
in surviving the disruptions and transitions coming our way, it will most 
likely lead to (1) the creation of new inequalities, (2) further 
fragmentation, and (3) more and deeper gaps between the rich and the 
poor, followed by more crime and even more barricaded property 
developments. Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 68

3.10 Globalisation, Supra-National Regionalisation, 
Gateway Nodes and National Connectivity 
and Integration
Despite the current setbacks for global trade, the long-term trend will be 
for (1) increased global trade, and (2) increasing integration of countries 
and cities in the global economy. The importance of being part of this 
global economy and to be ‘an equal partner’ in this system, will demand 
of countries, including South Africa, to ensure ease of access to their 
economies through well-functioning (1) global gateways, i.e. harbours, 
airports and border posts, and (2) a well-maintained national road and 
rail network. The latter will also ensure that the whole country, and not 
only parts of it become and remain part of this global economy. 
Prioritisation of routes on this network will be very important, as funds for 
road and rail connections will be severely limited. Where possible, rail 
should be prioritised, to (1) reduce carbon emissions and damage to 
roads by trucks, and (2) minimise the social costs that communities in 
towns with truck stops, especially their most vulnerable members, often 
suffer.
Significant changes are also envisaged in the top order of the global 
economy, with (1) China and India set to greatly strengthen their
positions, and (2) regional powerhouses, such as Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey 
and Mexico poised to increasingly make their presence felt. Furthermore, 
a number of countries on the African continent are rising rapidly, notably 
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Angola. Closer to 
home, Mozambique is growing at a steady pace, and Zimbabwe should 
be making rapid economic progress in the next few decades. Should 
South Africa wish to remain a part of this global economy, it will need to 
ensure that its urban and rural-based economies are globally 
competitive, which would amongst others, require (1) reducing 
constrains on small business development, and (2) the upskilling of our
labour force. From a national spatial perspective, South Africa must 
ensure that it ties its economy into the (1) new global economies, (2) 
regional powerhouses, and (3) emerging economies on the African 
continent. This must be done though aligning its ports with the growing 
significance of new trade routes to the east of the country, and ensuring 
fast and reliable connectivity through these ports to not only the 
Gauteng urban region, but also other regions in our country with strong 
export opportunities.
Of equal importance will be the strengthening of regional trading blocs, 
such as the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC), to (1) create greater regional consumer markets 
and (2) ensure more bargaining power when negotiating the terms of 
trade with other such blocs, e.g. the European Union. Alignment of 
national freight and logistics infrastructure, especially the (1) major road 
and rail corridors, but also (2) harbour infrastructure, will be required to 
establish and sustain strong regional linkages within SADC. 
Internally, if a fast-growing, well-connected and more inclusive economy 
is to be achieved, the development of movement infrastructure and a 
variety of modes of transport will have to be guided by a national spatial 
development pattern with at its base (1) the pursuit of more compact, 
concentrated settlement in fewer core national nodes, to reduce the 
number of main roads and railway lines to be built and maintained, (2) 
more mixed, higher density development, to reduce the need for 
motorised travel and distances to be travelled, and (3) higher levels of 
beneficiation and processing of raw materials, to reduce the volume of 
raw products that pass through our harbours and require road and rail 
transport and expensive infrastructure networks. 
The movement network will also have to be strengthened in the eastern 
escarpment and eastern and southern coastal areas, to support the Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 73
population, economic and climatic shifts described earlier in Section 3.6. 
In addition to this, infrastructure maintenance will have to be prioritised, 
not only for freight transport, but equally so for the safe, efficient and 
affordable movement of passengers, including tourists. In densely settled 
urban areas, a special emphasis will need to be placed on the provision 
of more affordable public transport services in Transit Oriented 
Development-configurations.
3.11 Institutional Weaknesses and Fragmentation 
and Prospects for National Developmental 
Action
In a country with the dreadful history of exploitation and targeted 
underdevelopment like South Africa’s, there are high expectations of the
State to assist in (1) correcting the wrongs of the past, (2) healing the stillopen wounds, and (3) creating a different and better future. This is, and 
has proven to be a huge endeavour, and one that government has 
managed to attend to with different degrees of success. What has not 
made this ‘national transformation, reconstruction and redevelopment 
task’ any easier is the ‘cutting-up and parcelling-out’ of inherently highly 
integrated national reconstruction, transformation and redevelopment 
tasks to different spheres of government in terms of the Constitution, with 
limited powers of one sphere over another to bring about (or force) the 
required nationally-focused and significant alignment, integration and 
coordination. In addition to this, the need to bring other spheres of 
government on board in planning processes, also has a cost-implication, 
requiring of officials to (1) meet and talk through such tasks, and (2) try to 
find ways to coordinate, align and harmonize their actions. 
Given a wide range of reasons, notably (1) the costs involved, (2) the lack 
of enforcement of decisions reached in multi-stakeholder engagement 
sessions, (3) the different modalities and work and budget-cycles, and (4) 
the unique particularities of decision-making in the different spheres and 
sectors of government, national sector departments have increasingly 
focused on fulfilling their mandates and going it alone in their pursuit of 
meeting their set targets. In addition to this, inefficiency, incompetence, 
corruption and theft of state resources has (1) led to an erosion of trust in 
public institutions, (2) severely damaged the culture of service delivery in 
the public service, and (3) siphoned off billions of Rands required for 
redress and development. The result has been an increasingly frustrated 
populace that has lost much of its trust in the State and its capabilities. 
Another outcome of State failure has been an increasingly greater 
reliance on (1) the private sector and (2) outside countries and entities to 
finance much-needed infrastructure investment. While ‘it may get things 
done’, it may also lead to (1) the country losing control over its resources,
and (2) an inability to implement plans and frameworks that are in the 
national interest, rather than those that are in the interests of the private 
investors or foreign countries.
In the provincial sphere, many provincial governments have prepared 
provincial economic growth and development plans and spatial 
development frameworks to attend to their economic, spatial 
development and human settlement challenges, but have in most cases 
lacked (1) the funds required to put these plans into motion, given that 
the bulk of their funds are tied to the provision of education, health and 
welfare services, and (2) struggled to secure national sector department
and municipal buy-in to and support for these plans and frameworks.
In the local space, municipalities are increasingly struggling to provide 
basic municipal services, often overwhelmed by the huge national 
redevelopment and transformation tasks they have been given. And, 
while the crucial and potentially very powerful (1) spatial planning and 
transformation, and (2) land use management functions resort with them, 
most municipalities lack the leadership, technical capacity and finances 
to adequately execute their mandates. At the same time, many Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 74
municipalities have turned ever-more inward, both in terms of municipal 
planning and the provision of municipal services, which has been hugely 
detrimental to progressive, transformative municipal-wide planning, and 
subsequently also provincial and national planning and transformation. 
In addition to this, in distressed mining and heavy manufacturing areas,
municipalities were not only hard-hit by job losses and business closures, 
but also lost their steady and significant incomes from the sale of water 
and electricity to mines and factories. In many rural areas, municipalities 
have struggled to prepare credible plans and achieve the desired 
developmental impact, given (1) the vast size of their areas of jurisdiction, 
(2) a lack of capacity, and (3) the enormity of their inherited service 
backlogs.
While the State is and remains crucial to the reconstruction, 
transformation and development of our country, it is currently struggling 
to do so. Inadequate funding and capacity, and a loss of trust and 
legitimacy in the eyes of the people, coupled with a deficit of political 
will, are key constraints on this crucial endeavour. Failure to deliver on 
much smaller tasks has also reduced confidence in the ability of the State 
to attend to the large national transformation questions. As such, 
rebuilding trust and showing progress in the areas of transformation will 
be crucial in the next decade. Making good on planned interventions
and ensuring feasibility of investments in terms of a long-term plan will also 
assist in this regard. To do so within the limited budgets available will 
require (1) far more spatial targeting, integration and alignment in 
infrastructure investment and development spending by the State, and 
(2) ensuring that existing and possible systemic links between places and 
communities are optimised. Careful planning of the placing, type and 
reach of State facilities will go a long way in assisting such processes. 
Equally so will be careful planning of the national spatial development 
pattern, to concentrate resources and investment in areas where the 
majority of our people are living and are likely to live in future. Such 
national, regional and local-scale planning will, however, require (1) 
staffing of government departments and municipalities with well-trained, 
ethically-solid professionals; (2) far more direction and clarity in terms of 
what is to be done, where, when, for how long, and by whom; and (3) 
the introduction of the necessary systems to drive and assess compliance 
and ensure accountability.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 75

3.12 Key National Spatial Development Dynamics, 
Challenges and Opportunities
The key national spatial development challenges and opportunities (1) 
that emerged from the discussion of the ten National Spatial 
Development Shapers and (2) that the NSDF will have to respond to are:
• Providing life chances and a decent quality of life to an 
additional 17 to 22 million people between now and 2050, within 
the context of (1) an ever-smaller habitable land area due to 
climate change, (2) ever-more stressed, threatened and 
compromised ecological spaces and systems, and (3) ever-fewer 
natural resources;
• Ensuring rapid redress at scale to Black South Africans (1) 
dispossessed of their land, (2) systematically excluded from the 
economy, and (3) severely restricted and stinted in their life 
chances, while at the same time rapidly growing and 
transforming the economy and transforming national, provincial 
and local space;
• Maintaining national biodiversity and ecosystem integrity for 
global, national and local resilience within an environment of a 
young, dynamic and aspirational population; 
• Managing competition between human activity and nationally 
important ecosystems and the essential services they provide, 
notably so with regards to water production, energy generation, 
mining, manufacturing and food production in the central and 
eastern parts of the country;
• Managing surface and groundwater use and potentially harmful 
land-uses in surface-water production areas, preventing 
contamination of water bodies and sources by human activities, 
rehabilitating contaminated water bodies, streams and rivers and 
maintaining bulk and local reticulation water infrastructure;
• Making the shift to a greener, low-carbon, more service-based 
economy through (1) compact, mixed land-use well-connected 
urban and rural settlement development, (2) the provision of 
enabling municipal services, and (3) efficient and affordable ICT 
and transport infrastructure investment and development;
• Optimising the enormous economic growth and job creation 
opportunities that dense, compact and diverse urban 
agglomerations and development corridors offer in the areas of 
human-to-human service provision, trade, entertainment, and 
the creative industries, especially so in an ICT-rich, but also jobthreatening 4th Industrial Revolution environment;
• Improving the quality of life and human capability in a fiscallyconstrained environment through (1) the well-located, planned 
and integrated provision of social services, and (2) the 
optimisation of the economic and employment benefits of such 
service provision in all our cities, towns and villages;
• Transforming the current highly financialised commercial farming 
agricultural sector into a mixed system, including hundreds of 
thousands of small and medium-sized producers, and optimising 
the economic dividends from the research, marketing, financing 
and equipment development opportunities that this transition will 
create in both urban and rural South Africa; 
• Competing in the global economy through innovative product 
and service development in especially our large cosmopolitan 
urban regions, with an emphasis on (1) the creative industries,
and (2) the cultural and entertainment sectors, and utilising both 
of these to bolster our tourism offering; 
• Optimising the enormous economic opportunities that SADC
offers for (1) trade, (2) collaborative research and knowledge
development, packaging and distribution, (3) water-sharing, and 
(4) energy generation;Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 81
• Identifying and utilising opportunities for the beneficiation of 
minerals, metals and agricultural products where it is 
economically viable and ecologically sustainable; and
• Optimising our existing national transport infrastructure network
by (1) prioritising rail over road, and (2) investing in and 
maintaining the most crucial components of the network, with an
emphasis on connecting global gateways, core urban nodes 
and regional development anchors throughout the country.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 82
PART FOUR: National Spatial Development Vision, Logic, Levers 
and OutcomesDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 83
4.1 Introduction
In this part of the NSDF a number of the core components of the National 
Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2) are covered. In the first section, the 
National Spatial Development Vision to direct, guide and align spatial 
planning, infrastructure investment and development is provided. This is 
followed by an exposition of the shifts that need to be made from the 
current National Spatial Development Logic to the required PostApartheid National Spatial Development Logic in accordance with the 
National Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2). Following this exposition 
is an introduction to, and overview of a series of ‘National Spatial 
Development Levers’ to bring about the Post-Apartheid National Spatial 
Development Pattern in accordance with the Post-Apartheid National 
Spatial Development Vision and Logic. This is followed by a section 
outlining a series of five National Spatial Development Outcomes that 
must and will be accomplished by (1) making the shifts in accordance 
with the Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development Logic, and (2) 
putting the National Spatial Development Levers to their envisaged use. 
These outcomes connect the National Spatial Development Vision and 
Logic, as set out in this part of the NSDF (i.e. Part Four) to the desired 
National Spatial Development Pattern in Part Five. Following this section is 
a vision of what life could be like in South Africa in 2050 should we jointly 
(1) work towards the vision, (2) make the necessary shifts in our spatial 
development logic, (3) use the levers as envisaged, and (4) pursue the 
outcomes, as set out in this part of the NSDF.
4.2 The National Spatial Development Vision
The purpose of the Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development Vision
is to provide a long-term guiding light for realising our desired PostApartheid National Spatial Development Pattern. As set out in the 
National Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2) and the NSDF’s Theory of 
Change (see Section 1.4.3), this vision is:
• Derived and drawn from the National Development Paradigm,
with as its key pillars the Constitution, the NDP, and the full suite of 
post-1994 legislation and policy; and
• Prepared within the current and anticipated future challenges 
and associated opportunities facing our country (see Part 3 and 
specifically Section 3.13).
In addition to the more eternal long-term National Spatial Development 
Vision and accompanying Mission-statement (see Figure 29 below), a 
time-bound 2050-National Spatial Development Vision is provided in 
Section 4.5. This vision serves to make (1) the future more tangible, and 
(2) our infrastructure investment and development spending actions 
more measurable in terms of moving our country from where it is now to 
where we want it to be.
4.3 The National Spatial Development Logic 
A key driver in the NSDF’s theory of change (see Section 1.4.3) is the move 
from a National Spatial Development Logic based on, and in service of 
the colonial and Apartheid National Development Paradigms, to one 
based on and in service of a Post-Apartheid National Development 
Paradigm. In this regard, it is framed and guided by:
• The NDP targets, strategic levers and strategic policy direction; 
and
• The five normative principles, as provided in SPLUMA. 
In this section of the framework, (1) the direction and guidance provided 
by the NDP and the five SPLUMA principles, and (2) the shifts that have to 
be made in the National Spatial Development Logic are set out.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 84
Figure 29: The National Spatial Development Vision Statement
“All Our People Living in Shared and Transformed Places in an 
Integrated, Inclusive, Sustainable and Competitive National 
Space Economy”
The accompanying Mission Statement reads as follows:
“Making our Common Desired Spatial Future Together Through 
Better Planning, Investment, Delivery and Monitoring”
4.3.1 The NDP as Guide and Driver
The NDP identifies a set of national development priorities, which include 
targets for economic growth and employment, equality and prosperity. 
It also identifies (1) inclusive growth, (2) the capacity of our people, and 
(3) a capable state, as the levers to achieve these targets. The link 
between the targets, levers and strategic policy direction, as provided in 
the NDP, is summarised in Figure 30.
Figure 30: The NDP Levers and Objectives-FrameworkDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 85
The national spatial development implications of the strategic direction 
provided by the NDP in the formulation of a new National Spatial 
Development Logic can be interpreted as follows:
(a) With regards to Inclusive Growth
A need to:
• Transit to a compact, service-based, resource-efficient space 
economy, that includes both rural and urban spaces, and that 
recognises the limitations of our national natural resource base;
• Consider the long-term resilience-benefits of a more compact 
settlement footprint in spaces less prone to the impacts of climate 
change, and adjust (1) settlement development forms and 
patterns, (2) housing types, building materials and construction 
methods, and (3) transport and service networks accordingly;
• Increase access and remove barriers to (1) the often 
concentrated and barricaded benefits of the national resource 
base, and (2) the locational benefits and amenities of exquisite 
and exclusive places developed for the few;
• Promote inclusive and sustainable urban settlement growth and 
facilitate movement and trade in and between settlements; 
• Support growing economic nodes in previously forgotten and 
ignored regions, and ensure a more diversified economy;
• Deal with declining mining and industrial areas in compassionate, 
smart, affordable and sustainable ways; and
• Recognise and develop settlements in accordance with their (1) 
roles in the national space economy and network of settlements, 
(2) regional and local contexts/settings, and (3) labourabsorption capacities.
(b) With regards to the Capacity of our People
A need to: 
• Ensure access to, and provision of quality services to all South 
Africans, to enable the development of human capital 
irrespective of where it is located in the country;
• Develop national urban centres of service excellence and 
innovation, to drive and maintain the global competitiveness of 
our country; and
• Develop differentiated, place-specific and viable responses to 
critical issues, such as service gaps, migration hot-spots, high 
levels of youth unemployment and exclusion, and land 
availability and tenure-related issues.
(c) With regards to a Capable State
A need to:
• Recognise and use (1) spatial planning as a tool for 
transformation, and (2) spatial planning processes and plans,
such as SDFs, as opportunities for integrating and coordinating
State action;
• Introduce a new spatial development logic and vision in the 
process of building a new, cohesive society; and
• Attend to state capacity gaps, to ensure fulfilment of the NDP’s 
developmental agenda.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 86
4.3.2 The SPLUMA Principles as Guide and Driver
In addition to the policy directives provided by the NDP, SPLUMA provides 
five guiding principles that have to be used and observed in all spatial 
planning processes at all scales, including the national scale. These 
principles are the following:
• Spatial justice;
• Spatial sustainability;
• Spatial resilience;
• Spatial efficiency; and
• Good administration.
In terms of the formulation of a new National Spatial Development Logic, 
the following guidance and direction is drawn from these principles:
(a) Spatial Justice
A need to:
• Ensure redress in terms of access to the economic opportunities 
and locational benefits that the country and its cities, towns and 
rural areas offer, including well-located, productive land;
• Include inclusion of previously excluded areas in the national 
space economy; and
• Pursue intergenerational justice in (1) the location and pattern of 
settlement development, and (2) the use of natural resources.
(b) Spatial Sustainability
A need to:
• Ensure national spatial development within the limits of the 
natural resource base of the country – now and in the future;
• Pursue the development of viable settlements and sustainable 
economies; and
• Pursue a more concentrated, well-connected and more 
compact national footprint, to increase access to opportunities 
for all, and reduce (1) use and wastage of natural resources and 
State finances, and (2) the need for motorised transport.
(c) Spatial Resilience
A need to:
• Proactively minimise risks to settlements though the considered 
selection of the location and pattern of settlement development; 
and
• Develop settlements in ways that reduce their dependency on 
carbon-based fuels and grid-based energy-distribution systems, 
as and where possible, to mitigate and reduce their climatic 
impact.
(d) Efficiency
A need to:
• Optimise the use of all State and non-State resources, and 
minimise the negative impacts of settlement development,
wherever it is done and whatever spatial form it takes; and
• Diversify and densify settlements to reduce transactional costs 
and the need for motorised transport.
(e) Good AdministrationDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 87
A need to:
• Pursue coordination, integration and spatial alignment in all forms 
of government spatial planning, budgeting and investment;
• Ensure maximum participation and active engagement in spatial 
planning and settlement building, grow the local economy and 
tax base, and build social cohesion; and
• Ensure adherence to the law, notably SDFs and municipal Land 
Use Schemes (LUSs), to ensure that the social, spatial and 
economic benefits of good spatial planning materialise. 
4.3.3 The Necessary ‘Shifts’
Based on the NDP and SPLUMA as guides and drivers, the following 
interrelated shifts in the National Spatial Development Logic are 
proposed by the NSDF to ensure the movement to a truly Post-Apartheid 
National Spatial Development Pattern:
(a) With regards to the beneficiaries of national spatial planning and 
spatial development
• Placing the interests and benefit of the many at centre stage, 
and not those of a/the few;
• Ensuring access for all to the use of land for residential, social, 
economic and cultural purposes, both in urban and rural areas;
• Limiting the development of luxury enclaves and estates for the 
use and enjoyment of the few; and
• Ensuring rapid release of land through well-planned urban and 
rural land reform at scale, for the use, development and 
enjoyment by the many.
(b) With regards to our natural resource base
• Placing a much greater focus on, creating a much greater 
awareness of, and introducing a far greater quantification of our
natural resource base, to enable and enhance the sustainable 
use and protection of critical natural resources;
• Making a clearer distinction between the ecological and 
economic value of natural resources and pursuing a far greater 
interest in and understanding of future trends and risks in natural 
resource use;
• Identifying and earmarking broad categories of (1) high-value 
agricultural land for national food security and agrarian reform, 
and (2) environmentally-significant areas for the provision and use 
of essential ecosystem services.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 88
(c) With regards to the nature, function and performance of our 
settlements
• Recognising our settlements as ‘our new gold’, and establishing a 
new, renewable people and place-based economy based on 
human interaction and ingenuity in quality urban spaces, and no 
longer a finite, ecologically-unfriendly mineral and metals 
resource-extraction driven economic model; 
• Reframing the old logic of cities as ‘engines of growth’ in service 
of capital, to ‘cities as engines of radical transformation in service 
of inclusive, people-focused, people-driven development and 
transformation’, and unleashing the enormous opportunities they 
offer for (1) the human-to-human services sector, (2) the 
innovation, knowledge-creation, valorisation and sharing sector, 
(3) the culture, entertainment and restaurant sector, and (4) the 
domestic and international tourism sector;
• Optimising the dividend of the millions of young South Africans 
that will be entering higher education, and be (1) gaining new 
insights, (2) ‘making new sense’ of the world, and (3) developing 
new forms of knowledge;
• Recognising cities as democratic spaces in which millions of 
economic activities and transactions take place and can take 
place, and in doing so, have the power to disrupt and destroy the 
highly concentrated, monopolistic nature of our economy;
• Emphasising the need to develop a new kind of city in which 
public space can become a key driver of a new ‘people’s 
economy from below’;
• Pursuing a denser, smaller, polycentric system of settlements that 
has (1) a smaller footprint, and (2) spans urban and rural areas;
• Making a clear distinction between the roles and capacity of 
different types of settlement on the national settlement network; 
and
• Recognising the need for the future-proofing of cities as sites of 
human innovation in becoming active participants in, and not 
victims of the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the 4th Industrial 
Revolution.
(d) With regards to our rural areas
• Recognising the need to develop and strengthen regional-rural 
systems in the pursuit of vibrant, inclusive and sustainable rural 
development;
• Pursuing the identification, development and strengthening of 
‘regional development anchors’ in rural areas, to (1) connect 
urban to rural areas in mutually-beneficial ways, and (2) act as 
catalysts for regional-rural development;
• Developing a systems-based ‘polycentric rural service-delivery 
network’ around regional developments anchors and carefully 
selected ‘rural service towns’, to provide quality public services, 
and ensure far greater levels of rural-to-rural interaction and local 
economic development;Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 89
• Exploring the delineation of ‘rural edges’ in rural areas to ensure 
the protection of (1) the unique, intrinsic qualities of our rural 
areas, (2) the cultural, customary and historical value they have, 
and (3) the often highly sensitive ecosystems they harbour;
• Pursuing intra-rural trade as core systemic and social 
glue/cohesion-activity between villages and towns in rural areas, 
and not shopping malls, which at core are little more than ‘onesided-extraction transaction points’; and
• Pursuing greater resilience of rural areas through diversification, in 
so doing ensuring that they are not and do not become ‘singleeconomic sector’ places.
(e) With regards to the nature, significance, form and impact of spatial 
development planning
• Ensuring greater coordination, integration and collaboration in 
spatial development planning, both in and between the spheres 
and sectors of government, including the use of (1) national 
spatial targeting and (2) differentiated responses to the potentials
and challenges of designated sub-national intervention areas;
• Investing at scale in areas identified for future economic growth, 
for the necessary period of time to make an impact, and with the 
benefit of not only the national economy, but also the regional 
and local economies in mind;
• Placing a far greater focus on the developmental impact of 
national investment and spending initiatives on (1) sub-national 
regions and (2) the livelihoods and well-being of communities in 
such regions;
• Introducing a ‘spatial transformation accountability system’ to set 
spatially-focused targets, and drive and measure progress with 
regards to (1) targeted investment in national priority spaces, (2) 
spatial transformation, and (3) the wise utilisation of our natural 
resource base; and
• Driving far greater involvement in, and support by sector 
departments and provinces in municipal spatial development 
planning, to ensure (1) the preparation and use of progressive, 
quality municipal SDFs, and (2) the enforcement of land-use
policies and rules emanating from such SDFs in municipal Land 
Use Management Systems (LUMSs), as provided for in SPLUMA.
4.4 National Spatial Development Levers
In order to (1) give spatial expression to the National Spatial Development 
Vision, and (2) support the shifts that need to be made in accordance 
with the new National Spatial Development Logic, a series of ‘National 
Spatial Development Levers’ were developed. These levers have their 
home in:
• The contextual realities, challenges and opportunities, as set out 
in Part Three;
• The drivers, levers and principles as set out in the NDP, the IUDF 
and SPLUMA (see Sections 1.3.2 and 4.3);
• What is considered ‘good spatial and settlement planning’ in 
local and international planning policy frameworks, guidelines 
and practice; and
• The theoretical domains of spatial development planning, urban 
design, regional and rural development planning, institutional 
economics, agglomeration economics, and ecological resource 
planning and management.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 90
Six such National Spatial Development Levers were developed. Each of 
these is discussed below (see Figures 31 and 32).Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 91
Figure 31: National Spatial Development LeversDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 92
Figure 32: Linking National Spatial Development Levers to the NDP and SPLUMADraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 93
4.4.1 Urban Areas and Regions as Engines of 
National Transformation, Innovation and 
Inclusive Economic Growth 
The IUDF argues that, “… in the 
economic history of humanity, 
urbanisation has always been an 
accelerator of growth and 
development, bringing about 
enormous changes in the spatial 
distribution of people and resources, 
and in the use and consumption of 
land”. With nearly 70% of South 
African’s population already living in 
cities and towns, and this figure set to rise to 80% by 2050, the NSDF shares 
this view, and argues that urban areas will play an increasingly important 
role in the development of a shared and sustainable South Africa. Urban 
areas will replace commodities as South Africa’s ‘new gold’. The NSDF 
does, however, hold that urban areas will only be able to perform this 
critical and desired role if:
• There are high levels of inter-connectivity between the country’s 
city regions, cities and towns, and they are all tightly integrated 
into a mutually beneficial and resilient national urban settlement 
network (see also Section 4.4.6 below);
• The benefits of agglomeration in urban areas are allowed to 
surface and flourish through (1) fast-tracked urban land reform 
and land release, (2) effective settlement planning, design and 
management, including growth management, (3) the 
introduction of regulations and land use management systems 
that focus on strategic and not petty matters, (4) densification, 
diversification and quality public place-making, (5) the provision 
of basic municipal and social services in a financially viable way,
(6) the provision and use of effective public transport and nonmotorised bicycle lanes and walkways, (7) stringent water 
demand and waste management, (8) the creation of safer 
environments, and (9) the provision of effective policing services;
and
• Regional-level urban development corridors between (1) cities 
and towns in urban regions, as well as (2) existing and emerging 
nodes within cities and towns (such as between township nodes,
suburban nodes and Central Business Districts) are planned, 
developed, supported and strengthened. 
4.4.2 National Spatial Development Corridors as 
Incubators and Drivers of New Economies and 
Quality Human Settlements 
National Spatial Development 
Corridors are large stretches of
densely-populated human 
settlements and intense
economic activity along/on
roads and/or railway lines. The 
dense human settlements, the road/railway links and the intensive 
economic activities mutually support each other in a synergistic way. 
While such corridors often develop organically over long periods of time, 
they can be supported and strengthened, and their development fasttracked though well-considered and targeted State interventions.
Interventions of this nature typically entail (1) the strengthening of the 
economy or the housing market in cities and towns in the corridor, (2) the 
construction of new, or the expansion and/or upgrading of existing road Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 94
and railway links in the corridor and/or (3) the provision of targeted 
incentives to support denser, more concentrated development in 
corridors with more sprawling settlement patterns.
The NSDF regards National Spatial Development Corridors as potentially 
powerful national spatial development levers, especially (1) along 
coastal-based tourist routes, and (2) in former Bantustan areas marked 
by dense, yet sprawling human settlements along roads and/or railway
lines. 
The development of such mega-scale National Spatial Development 
Corridors will, however, require:
• Intensive and sustained broad-based, multi-sectoral 
intergovernmental and SOE-collaboration, especially so with 
regards to the quantum, timing and spatial location of (1) land 
to be released for use/settlement, (2) infrastructure investment, 
upgrading and maintenance, (3) and social service provision;
• The development of urban areas in the corridor in accordance 
with the requirements for urban areas as set out in Section 4.4.1
above; and
• The availability of viable, real economic opportunities, which 
would ideally not be based on a single economic sector, to (1) 
enhance resilience, and (2) increase the prospect of developing
robust and diverse economies based on these opportunities.
4.4.3 Productive Rural Regions as Drivers of 
National Rural Transitions and Cornerstones of 
our National Resource Foundation
Rural areas, especially in the former 
Bantustans, (1) were zones of 
extreme neglect, and at the 
receiving end of the worst excesses 
of large-scale commercial farming, 
mining activities and urban-based 
manufacturing economies during 
colonial and Apartheid times, and 
(2) have of late been the sites of 
often well-intended, but piecemeal, unintegrated and fragmented spatial and economic 
development initiatives.
The NSDF puts forward a Regional-Rural Development Model (see Figure 
33) as a third National Spatial Development Lever. This model:
• Takes a systemic view of rural areas, and proposes the ‘soft 
delineation’ of ‘polycentric functional rural regions’ that have (1) 
at least one well-connected regional development anchor,
both within the region on the national transport network to 
‘anchor’ the region in the national space economy, (2) social, 
cultural, historical, economic and cultural characteristics and 
attributes that would make the development of a ‘functional 
rural region’ possible over time, and (3) the potential for intraregional trade between towns and villages in the region;
• Proposes the preparation of regional-rural development plans,
as the DRDLR has already begun to do in rural South Africa, for 
these regions, and include the projects and plans that are Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 95
identified in these plans in the IDPs and SDFs of the municipalities 
in whose areas of jurisdiction the regions fall;
• Requires that land reform be fast-tracked and undertaken within 
the framework of the regional-rural development plan, to ensure 
that suitable and well-located (1) agricultural land, and (2) 
stands in towns, are sought and released for productive 
purposes, and that the necessary support for beneficiaries 
(inputs, fencing, equipment, markets, finances, etc.) is properly 
planned for and undertaken in a systematic, structured and 
effective way;
• Requires wise natural resource use, management and 
protection;
• Utilises the Social Service Provisioning Model (see Section 4.4.4
and Figure 34) to (1) provide social services in villages, towns and 
regional development anchors in accordance with their role 
and place in the rural region, in the most effective, sustainable 
and affordable way, and (2) create at least one regional 
development anchor/town to attract and retain professionals 
and entrepreneurs who would otherwise generally not move to,
or stay in rural areas;
• Envisages the use of ‘rural edges’ (see Glossary of Terms) to 
protect the rural regions from intrusion of non-compatible and 
destructive land uses that could (1) disrupt or violate the rural 
integrity of the region, (2) compromise ecosystems on which the 
region relies, and (3) threaten local lifestyles and cultures in the 
region; and
• Depends on local people being duly empowered to become 
active participants in the development of their areas, and 
hence makes a move away in rural development thinking and 
practice from an approach of ‘transformation-from-above’ to 
one of ‘transformation-from-below’viii. 
Figure 33: Schematic Presentation of a Regional-Rural Development 
ModelDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 96
4.4.4 A National Spatial Social Service Provisioning 
Model to Ensure Effective, Affordable and 
Equitable Social Service Delivery
The realities of (1) national fiscal 
constraints, (2) the high construction, 
maintenance and staffing costs of
social services, and the (3) general 
inward focus in requests and 
proposals in municipal IDPs and SDFs 
for the placing of national and
provincial social service facilities, 
require that a rational allocation of 
facilities rendering social services be done in national space. In addition 
to this, investment in social infrastructure, if (1) planned well, (2) designed 
for multiple uses, and (3) placed in ‘the right location/spot’, e.g. on public 
transport routes, and in a place where adequate municipal services are 
available, in a village, town or city, can become:
• An attractor for economic activities and contribute to placemaking, urban densification and diversification; and 
• A catalyst for nodal development, and assist in reducing transport 
costs and limiting urban and rural sprawl. 
The provision of social services is also a creator of public sector jobs with 
secure incomes, which can assist in bringing a degree of predictability to 
the frequency and size of disposable income in a region or town. In rural 
areas, where settlement development was often not planned, the 
preparation of a proper ‘rural design framework/plan’ and the placing 
of government services in accordance with this framework/plan, could 
greatly assist in developing rural towns/settlements with solid, resilient 
public investment/capital structures. 
The National Spatial Social Service Provisioning Model (see Figure 33) put 
forward in the NSDF as a National Spatial Development Lever, works on a 
hierarchical base, with the highest order services with the largest spatial 
reach in each category (see Figure 34), being placed in the highest order 
placesix. In for instance the case of health care, regional hospitals would 
be placed in ‘national urban cores’ and ‘regional development 
anchors’, and mobile clinics in small villages. Likewise, universities would 
be located in ‘national urban cores’, high schools in ‘rural service 
centres’, and small schools and mobile libraries in villages.
While rather rigid in appearance, the model does not propose an ironcaged spatial investment model, but instead envisages a situation by 
which municipalities and national and provincial sector departments 
would use the ‘national and regional settlement and service network’ or 
’social service wheel’ for short, as strong indicator and guide in jointly 
engaging and deciding on the spatial allocation of facilities across 
space. In addition to this, the wheel could also be used to:
• Avoid and resolve intergovernmental disputes regarding the 
spatial location of social service facilities;
• Inform, structure and guide engagements by communities with 
government regarding the provisioning and spatial location of 
social services; and
• Engage and ‘interrogate’ spatial investment decisions by 
national and provincial sector departments and municipalities 
regarding social services in accordance with the NSDF’s 
envisaged ‘national spatial accountability model’ (see Parts 5 
and 6 of the NSDF). Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 97

4.4.5 A National Ecological Infrastructure System to 
Ensure a Shared, Resilient and Sustainable 
National Natural Resource Foundation 
It is both a (1) national spatial 
development and (2) human rights 
imperative to ensure sustainable 
and just access to natural 
resources for current and future 
generations. The National Spatial 
Development Vision recognises 
this, and specifically refers to the 
need for our country’s natural 
resources to be shared and used by all in a sustainable manner. In order 
to give spatial expression to this imperative, the NSDF puts forward the 
introduction of a National Spatial Ecological Infrastructure System as a 
national spatial development lever in recognition of:
• The limited availability of high-value agricultural land, and seeks 
to ensure that this resource is identified and managed with the 
utmost of care to ensure national food security;
• The high levels of regional interdependency between water 
catchment areas and the enormous volumes of water transfers
in the country, and hence the need to protect (1) surface water
production catchment areas from encroachment by noncompatible land-uses, as well as (2) underground water sources
from contamination by noxious economic activities; and
• The major changes in land suitability and habitability that 
extreme climate change is set to bring to our country, and 
hence the need to identify those areas that will most likely be 
least affected by climate change, and ringfencing, preserving 
and protecting these areas for (1) future (emergency) use for 
water and food production, and (2) the provision of crucial 
national ecological ecosystem services.
The National Spatial Development Lever put forward in the NSDF in this 
regard seeks to (1) identify those areas of crucial national ecological 
significance, and (2) propose measures to ensure their protection and 
management, and their reservation as such, in all provincial, regional 
and municipal SDFs to be prepared from hence forth.
4.4.6 A National Transport, Communications and 
Energy Infrastructure Network to Ensure a 
Shared, Inclusive and Sustainable Economy 
A well-functioning and wellmanaged national transport and 
connectivity infrastructure network 
that ensures and enables (1) the 
safe and efficient movement of 
people, (2) the flow of information 
and communication, (3) the movement of goods and flow of services, 
(4) global connectivity and interaction in the global economy, is crucial 
to the spatial development and economic life of any country. Given (1) 
the high costs associated with the construction, upgrading and 
maintenance of such networks, which include airports, harbours, border 
posts, logistic hubs, electricity, fiber networks, broadband, natural gas
pipelines, and road and rail networks, and (2) the need to recover such 
costs through use, a country has to carefully plan where these networks 
are to be built/installed. In the case of South Africa, the legacy of historic 
national development paradigms in terms of which such networks 
supported first colonial extraction and export, and later the creation of 
the Apartheid State for a White minority, requires that these networks be Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 99
strategically planned, built and maintained in support of post-Apartheid 
spatial transformation and inclusive economic growth.
The National Spatial Development Lever put forward in the NSDF with 
regards to transport and communications infrastructure networks, seeks
to ensure:
• Investment in maintaining, strengthening and expanding
connectivity, to ensure the creation of a solid transport and 
communications network between urban areas, regional
development anchors and smaller towns and villages in such 
regions, with a focus on (1) ensuring the roll-out and continuous 
upgrading of broadband access to all South Africans, and (2) 
prioritising rail over road infrastructure;
• More people-focused infrastructure investment, such as (1) 
upgrading infrastructure networks in major urban areas and 
towns, to accommodate far higher densities and intensities, (2) 
installing and maintaining infrastructure networks in former 
township areas at scale, so as to develop these previously 
neglected areas into high-quality urban living spaces, and (3) 
developing quality public spaces, pedestrian walkways and
efficient, affordable and safe public transport networks for use by 
all;
• More upgrading of ageing urban municipal service infrastructure
and large-scale investment of municipal infrastructure in regional 
development anchors and rural service towns; and 
• More investment in the enabling and catalytic infrastructure
required for (1) renewable energy generation, storage and 
distribution, (2) smallholder farming and agro-processing, (3) 
tourism, culture and entertainment-led economic growth, and (4) 
innovation and knowledge-creation, packaging and transfer.
4.5 National Spatial Development Outcomes
4.5.1 Introduction
This section outlines a series of five National Spatial Development 
Outcomes that must and will be accomplished by (1) making the shifts as 
set out Section 4.3, and (2) using the National Spatial Development Levers
as set out Section 4.4. These outcomes, each of which is briefly described 
in the following five sections, connect the National Spatial Development 
Vision and Logic in this part of the NSDF (Part Four) to the desired PostApartheid National Spatial Development Pattern as set out in Part Five.
4.5.2 National Spatial Outcome One
A network of consolidated, transformed and wellconnected national urban nodes, regional 
development anchors, and development corridors that 
enable South Africa to derive maximum transformative benefit from 
urbanisation, urban living and inclusive economic development. 
In terms of this outcome:
• Consolidated and quality settlements are provided with the 
necessary social and economic infrastructure for a fast-growing 
population in a way that considers (1) all our available natural 
and man-made resources, and enabling and empowering 
technologies, and (2) the need to provide for both current and 
future generations;
• National urban regions and nodes act as national and global 
gateways for trade, tourism and national political functions, and 
gateways for African and regional integration;
• High-density urban nodes provide opportunities for interaction, 
innovation and enterprise development within existing, as well as 
new, inclusive and interaction centred enterprise economies;Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 100
• A well-developed service infrastructure system acts as basis for 
just access to high quality social and other services in:
o A strong and well-functioning polycentric system of wellconnected urban core areas within wider functional urban 
regions and corridors that offer a wide range of high-order 
medical, education, government, safety and security, tradegateway and economic services is put in place; and
o A network of vibrant regional development anchor towns, 
with strong rural-rural connections to strategically located 
rural service towns that act as regional-rural service providers,
is created.
4.5.3 National Spatial Outcome Two 
National corridors of opportunity enable sustainable 
and transformative national development, 
urbanisation, urban consolidation, mutually beneficial urban and rural 
linkages, and ecological management. 
In terms of this outcome:
• Economic growth, consolidated settlement development and 
trade infrastructure and trade are located within well-connected 
inter-regional and national development corridors and routes;
• Urbanisation, settlement growth and the dynamically changing 
needs of a growing population are directed, attracted to, and 
accommodated in a system of national urban regions and 
nodes, with specific emphasis on national-scale transformation 
and development corridors that provide opportunities for 
regional adaptation through:
o Settlement transformation and consolidation and inclusive 
urban economies;
o Effective land-management and custodianship of national 
strategic water production and ecological sensitive areas; 
and
o Sustainable eco-agri-enterprise activities and livelihoods. 
4.5.4 National Spatial Outcome Three
National connectivity and movement infrastructure 
systems are strategically located, extended and maintained, to support 
a diverse, adaptive and inclusive space economy and a set key national 
and regional gateway cities and towns.
In terms of this outcome:
• The national transport, trade and communication network is 
aligned with, and serves the identified nodes and development 
corridors in a way that supports the development needs of our 
growing population though (1) effective support for the 
economy, (2) the delivery of quality services, and (3) growth in 
employment;
• All national road, rail, air, maritime and ICT networks and 
infrastructure are aligned and prioritised, based on the demand 
and volume of services, as well as future growth in identified 
areas;
• Transport and logistic links serve natural resource-based 
economies in areas focused on (1) the export of raw materials, 
and (2) processing-activities related to mining, agriculture, 
forestry and manufacturing;
• Local freight needs, movement, passenger transport 
infrastructure and management skills/capabilities are spatially 
aligned and phased to support identified nodes and connecting 
corridors;
• Effective development of all national ports of entry, including (1) 
upgrading and maintenance of logistics infrastructure and (2) the Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 101
provision of efficient customs services, is ensured, to support the 
international and regional flow of goods, services and people;
• National water and energy-distribution infrastructure is 
expanded, upgraded and maintained to ensure national water 
and energy supply and distribution.
4.5.5 National Spatial Outcome Four 
Productive rural regions, supported by sustainable 
resource economies and strong and resilient regional 
development anchors that provide access to people 
living in rural areas to the national and global economy.
In terms of this outcome:
• National food security, rural transformation and rural enterprise 
development and quality of life in rural South Africa are enabled 
and supported through a set of strong regional development 
anchors in functional regional-rural economies;
• Well-functioning, well-connected and productive rural regions (1) 
strengthen and enhance rural development and the well-being 
of rural communities, and (2) ensure the wise use, management 
and protection of nationally significant natural resources in these 
regions;
• Differentiated rural development (as called for in Chapter 6 of the
NDP) entailing small, medium and large-scale agriculture, agroprocessing, agro-eco enterprises, tourism and natural resource 
management and protection, play a key role in creating 
economic opportunities, and addressing poverty, unemployment 
and inequality in these regions and the country as a whole;
• Large and strategically located smaller towns in rural areas with 
significant rural-regional reach in terms of social service provision, 
tourism, personal services and administrative functions, act as 
regional development anchors to support functional regionalrural systems;
• Urban consolidation and growth, innovation and contextspecific access to housing and service opportunities, both in 
sparsely-populated and densely-settled rural areas is pursued 
through the identification and development of strategicallylocated ‘regional development anchors’; and
• A set of well-connected, strategically located smaller towns act 
as ‘rural service centres’ to (1) ensure mutually beneficial urbanrural and rural-rural market linkages, and (2) provide distributed, 
but efficient access to critical social services and sustainable 
livelihood and settlement opportunities within diverse and 
productive rural regions.
4.5.6 National Spatial Outcome Five
National ecological Infrastructure and the national 
natural resource foundation is well-protected and 
managed, to enable sustainable and just access to water and other 
natural resources, both for current and future generations.
In terms of this outcome:
• The national water capture, storage and inter-regional transfer 
system is well-planned, funded and maintained, and, together 
with the introduction of far more stringent national, regional and 
local water-supply management measures, ensures (1) national 
water security and well-being, and (2) quality livelihoods for all;
• Ensuring water availability over the long-term takes centre-stage 
in well-aligned and integrated long-term national, provincial and 
municipal strategic and sector planning processes, and includes
a focus on national and supra-national regional waterinterdependencies;Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 102
• National ecological infrastructure and resources are protected 
and well-managed in officially protected national and provincial 
parks and ocean areas;
• National ecological and biodiversity management areas, as the 
foundation of our national ecological infrastructure system that 
sustains all life and livelihoods, are recognised as such, and 
protected by law; and
• In full recognition of our complex inter-regional and national 
spatial interdependencies, and the impact of spatial 
development on ecological resources and infrastructure systems, 
national spatial development and land-use is well-planned and 
effectively managed.
4.6 Putting it All Together: Life in South Africa 2050: 
The Long-Term National Spatial Development 
Vision, Logic and Levers in Action
In this section, the 2050-National Spatial Development Vision as tangible 
expression of what the desired future will entail once the Post-Apartheid 
National Spatial Development Vision, Logic and Levers have been put 
into action, is presented. It reads as follows…
75 Million South Africans
It is April 2050. A year earlier, during South Africa’s 55th ‘27 AprilDemocracy Celebrations’, the 75th million South African was born in the 
Buffalo City urban region. This massive urban conglomeration, is one of 
the ‘big four’ urban conurbations along the South African east coast, 
that are now jointly home to more than eight million South Africans. These 
four urban conurbations have grown rapidly – their growth equalling that 
of the Cape Town urban region, with its more than six million inhabitants. 
Despite their rapid growth, they are still a long way off from the Gauteng 
urban region with its population of more than 22 million people. Together 
with the booming cities of Polokwane, Mbombela, Rustenburg, Msunduzi 
and Mangaung, each with their populations of around 1 million people, 
the eleven urban conurbations are now home to around 42 million 
people, or around 60% of the South African population (see Figure 36).Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 103
Figure 36: National Spatial Development Pattern TransformedDraft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 104
Eleven Urban Conurbations
In contrast to days gone by in which large parts of metropolitan South 
Africa were described as lifeless and boring, these areas are now hives 
of activity. Three-to-six storey mixed-use buildings are the norm in the 
buzzing former inner-city areas and along dense activity-streets in many 
of the suburbs of these erstwhile cities. Rooftops are in most cases used 
for (1) food production, preparation and distribution, (2) pop-up music 
performances, (3) poetry nights, and (4) plays. Some of them are used 
for solar and wind energy generation, alongside a myriad of other ways 
of doing so (1) on buildings and verandas, and (2) in larger commercial 
energy farms on high-lying areas and in the ocean, alongside the 
numerous thriving aquaculture projects.
Trade with African countries along the east coast of the continent, as well 
as with India and China, has boomed over the last three decades. In 
contrast to days gone by, this is far less in the form of the export of raw 
commodities, some of which are no longer shipped, such as coal, due to 
international carbon-trade-bans dating back to the early 2030s. These 
days, South Africa is a major exporter of a wide range of high-value handmade high-fashion clothing, jewellery, art, furniture, foodstuffs and 
beverages, which have become highly sought after in countries where 
nearly everything is made by machine. A key contributor to this new 
dawn for South Africa was the unveiling by government in the early 2020s 
of its massive and hugely successful ‘Smart Reindustrialisation 
Programme’ and its ‘Eastern South Africa Development Plan’. Driven by 
(1) the evermore-pressing drought in the western and north-western parts 
of the country, (2) the unfulfilled and deferred promise of the democracy 
that was won at such a high cost, and (3) the enormous agriculture, 
industrial and settlement development opportunities that lay east, and 
that were unlocked by the massive ‘New Land Reform Programme’ of 
the 2020s, government acted swiftly and decisively. And now, 25-30 years 
on, this is the outcome.
Transformation at Scale
The massive national-led ‘macro-restructuring and development plans’
not only resulted in shared economic growth and poverty alleviation at 
scale, but also assisted in inculcating a culture of ‘all-in’, targeted, 
integrated and coordinated planning. Out the door went untargeted, 
unplanned and unintegrated investment by government and the private 
sector, and the wastage of time and money by everyone pursuing their 
own plans and projects in their own backyards. In contrast to the early 
days of SPLUMA, when the introduction of the new suite of spatial 
planning instruments had very little impact on ridding the country of the 
legacy of colonial and Apartheid planning, the Act is now (1) used as 
intended, and (2) respected by government, communities and the 
private sector alike. 
In addition to the positive impacts the macro-restructuring and 
development plans had on the national spatial development planning 
system, the success of these plans assisted in making South Africans 
believe that they can, and that it was possible to develop a truly 
transformed, liberated and prosperous post-Apartheid South Africa. The 
fruits of this freed-up, confident country are everywhere to be seen – from 
the dynamic interplay between (1) well-targeted, wise government 
investment and (2) innovative, organic urban growth and land 
development by communities, to the booming SADC region. It is 
especially this regional bloc and the connections and free flow of goods, 
services and people that it has enabled, that have played a huge role in 
the national economic growth rate of on average between 3% and 6% 
since the mid-2020s. The benefits have not only been felt on the national 
level and in the big urban areas, as also smaller towns and rural areas 
have gained from it. Thinking SADC, nationally and locally when planning 
and investing in infrastructure, played a huge role in this success.

A Good Life in Urban South Africa
Life on the streets of urban South Africa is very different to the first two 
decades of the 2000s. In contrast to life back then, the streets are now 
filled with people and there is excitement in the air. There are now also 
far fewer cars in the streets, and all you hear is people’s voices and music 
– walking and cycling are now the most popular means of moving 
around, and the electrical buses and taxis barely make a noise. Instead 
of pavements packed with cars, there now are (1) many small places to 
eat, (2) salons where you can have your hair done, (3) little shops selling 
anything from fresh produce to health foods, (4) research, education 
and innovation institutes, where knowledge and ideas flow freely, and 
(5) art and culture academies, where young artists are primed, and 
where you can enjoy music, poetry and short plays and buy paintings
and sculptures. And it is here, in the vibrant streets and surrounding public 
spaces that never sleep, where many of the more than 75% of South 
Africans who now call ‘the city’ their home, make a life and live much of 
their lives. It is also here where South Africa and the rest of the world meet 
– where you see faces and hear languages from all over the planet. 
Many of these voices are those of tourists who love the vibrant and 
unique cosmopolitan atmosphere, and who have made South Africa 
one of the top ten tourist destinations in the world for the last 26 years in 
a row. Again, it was the foresight and decisive actions of government in 
the 2020s that succeeded in growing the sector into one of the largest 
and most dynamic in the country.
A Good Life in Rural South Africa
Rural South Africa is also in a very different shape to what is was in the 
late 2010s when it was a hard place to grow up in, money was tight, jobs 
were few and government services in many places non-existent or weak. 
This all started changing for the better when government launched its 
grant-funded ‘National Spatial Restructuring Priority Plans’ in the early 
2020s, with their focus on developing ‘functional rural regions’ throughout 
rural South Africa, and which entailed the carefully planned roll-out and 
provision of quality services in each of these regions in a systemic way in 
accordance with government’s so-called ‘social services wheel’. In 
many rural towns, there are now clinics, police stations, schools, arts and 
culture academies and sporting facilities, and even the smallest villages 
have lightning-fast communication networks. Hundreds of thousands of 
graduates deployed over the many years as interns, researchers, and 
tutors to rural schools, also assisted in making these plans a success. Very 
soon trade connections between smaller places in rural South Africa 
started growing, which soon saw the development of strong rural regions 
in areas where once there was little else but destitution and despair. At
the same time, with the growing movement of millions of retired South 
Africans to rural areas, the economies of these places have been given 
a strong and stable financial injection.
A Young, Free and Creative Country
Today, 56 years into democracy, South Africa is finally beginning to enjoy 
the full dividend of freedom and is fully able to (1) harness the energy,
creativity and vitality of its many young people, and (2) fuse it with the 
innovative flares and creative blazes of young people from the rest of the 
continent and all over the world.Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 106

PART FIVE: National Spatial Development and Investment 
GuidanceNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 108
5.1 Introduction
In this part of the NSDF, the desired Ideal National Spatial Development 
Pattern for South Africa in 2050 is put forward. The National Spatial 
Development Frame: Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern (see 
Figure 39) provides an image of a:
Resilient, sustainable and inclusive post-Apartheid national spatial 
development pattern that is well-served by a consolidated 
system of international, national and regional development 
nodes and corridors, with a highly productive network of rural 
regions, where development nodes, rural regions and hard 
infrastructure are embedded within the capabilities and 
interdependencies of the national ecological infrastructure 
system.
This ideal pattern is ‘detailed-out’ in five ‘Sub-Frames’x. These five SubFrames are:
• NSDF Sub-Frame One: Inter-Regional Connectivity;
• NSDF Sub-Frame Two: The National System of Nodes and 
Corridors;
• NSDF Sub-Frame Three: The National Resource Economy Regions;
• NSDF Sub-Frame Four: The National Movement and Connectivity 
Infrastructure System; and
• NSDF Sub-Frame Five: The National Ecological Infrastructure and 
Natural Resource System.
This Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern and the five Sub-Frames
were constructed:
• In adherence to the priorities of the National Development Plan
and the SPLUMA principles;
• In accordance with the National Spatial Development Vision and
Logic;
• By making use of the National Spatial Development Levers; and
• In pursuit of the National Spatial Development Outcomes (see
Figure 37.
Key considerations in constructing this ideal National Spatial 
Development Pattern and the five Sub-Frames were:
• National spatial development realities and national and 
international trends, movement patterns and technological 
advances, and (1) the challenges they present, and (2) the 
opportunities they offer;
• A significant growth in our national population of between 17 and 
22 million people between today and 2050;
• The (1) unique development potentials of places and areas, and 
(2) the roles they will have to play in national, regional and local 
economies, to realise our national development objectives of 
inclusive economic growth, job creation and poverty 
eradication;
• The need to (1) safeguard national food security, (2) make the 
transition to a low-carbon energy future, (3) ensure adequate 
provision of safe and affordable water, (4) protect, manage and 
maintain key ecosystems and the services they provide, and (5) 
recognise the interconnectedness and interdependencies
between places; and
• The multiple threats associated with climate change, such as (1) 
rising temperatures in the western and central parts of the 
country, (2) reduced water availability, and (3) growing 
unpredictability in the seasonal pattern of rainfall.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 109
Together, the Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern and the five
Sub-Frames provide:
• A national spatial schema to inform, direct, prioritise and guide all 
future infrastructure investment and development spending 
decisions by government and the private sector, to (1) optimise 
place-based potentials and spatial interdependencies, and (2) 
realise the 2050-National Spatial Development Vision and our 
core national development objectives, as encapsulated in our 
National Development Paradigm;
• Strategic spatial development and investment guidance to 
spatially direct plans, budgets and actions of public and private 
sector actors, to, over time (1) capitalise on key national spatial 
assets, locational potentials and agglomeration opportunities,
and (2) bring about decisive, rapid, sustainable and inclusive 
national development and transformation at scale;
• A carefully chosen, distinct set of nationally-significant places, 
connectors and areas in and around which to align, integrate 
and coordinate investment by the private sector and the three 
spheres of government when preparing and reviewing (1) 
area/place-based provincial, regional and municipal SDFs, and 
(2) sector-specific and macro-infrastructure national and SADCfocused investment plans;
• A brief outline of the key role-players responsible for driving 
spatial transformation, national adaptation and ‘national spatial 
development accountability’, as well as (1) the institutions that 
will be involved, and (2) the instruments that will be used in all 
three these regards; and
• A spatially-explicit assessment and accounting frame for 
monitoring and evaluating all spending and investment decisions 
by government and the private sector in space (specific places 
and interrelated spaces) and time (the short, medium and longterm).
Following on from the ideal spatial pattern and the sub-frames, is a set of 
five National Spatial Action Areas (NSAAs). These NSAAs represent the 
most urgent strategic spatial development catalysts to (1) bring about 
radical spatial transformation at scale, and (2) manage and mitigate 
rising national risks, and as such, require immediate national action.
Concerted and sustained intergovernmental collaboration is required in 
these NSAAs over the short term to:
• Target context-specific, focused and catalytic national spatial 
development interventions; and 
• Kickstart the process of aligning plans, budgets and 
departmental plans in and between spheres of government 
around national spatial development priorities.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 110

5.2 NSDF Sub-Frame One: Inter-Regional 
Connectivity
5.2.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance 
Supra-national development and investment in four inter-regional spatial 
networks are of particular importance to South Africa (see Figure 40). 
These relate to (1) energy supply, (2) transport and logistics services, (3) 
shared water resources, and (4) ecological infrastructure:
• Regionally-connected electricity networks enable South Africa to (1) 
buy electricity from Lesotho, Mozambique and Namibia when surplus 
is required, or (2) sell to Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, 
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe when it has excess production.xi
The SADC Energy Sector Plan indicates that, apart from the 
infrastructure projects in South Africa, there are also a number of 
planned (or by now current) projects aimed at increasing power 
generation in the region.xii Nationally, these are also under 
consideration through the Electricity Grid Infrastructure and Gas 
Pipeline Extension programme, for which a national Strategic 
Environmental Assessment (SEA) process is currently underway. 
Renewable energy has emerged as a rapidly-growing source that 
can add vastly to the energy mix in the region. Renewable energy 
projects have, however, faced serious challenges related to a lack 
of (1) policy and regulation, and (2) connecting infrastructure and 
financing. 
• Transport and logistics infrastructure has been identified as key to 
creating an enabling environment to (1) achieving the goal of 
sustainable regional socio-economic development, and (2) closing 
the widening gap in the provision of high-quality, efficient 
infrastructure, especially when considering road and rail 
infrastructure. In response to this, SADC adopted a spatial 
development corridor strategy in 2008. While railway lines are 
considered as crucial for (1) improved efficiency of movement of 
freight in the region, and (2) the protection of infrastructure 
investment in the regional road network, the railway network has seen 
only minimal improvement, revitalisation and expansion. Poor road 
quality and lack of maintenance in certain areas remain a critical 
concern in the case of both regional and urban roads. Although 
capacity currently exists on the road network, projections for 2027 
suggest the need for (1) further road-widening, (2) the construction 
of bypasses for major cities and passing-lanes in hilly regions, and (3) 
more efficient border-posts.xiii While the SADC railways generally 
operate far below their original design capacities, they cannot 
increase their volumes because of (1) poor track condition, (2) lack 
of locomotive and wagon availability, and (3) low operating capital. 
With regards to new railway investments directly impacting upon or 
driven by South Africa, the TRANSNET rail investment plan indicates a 
new rail line to Botswana (the Lephalale-Mahalapye line) for coal 
transport, as well as the upgrading of several lines to the major 
regional harbours, to support mineral exports.
• Water availability across SADC varies. The countries with the greatest 
demand unfortunately also have the most limited supply. South Africa 
shares several water catchment basins with neighbouring countries 
including (1) the Orange-Senqu basin (Namibia and Botswana), (2) 
the Limpopo basin (Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique), (3) the 
Inkomati basin (Swaziland and Mozambique), and (4) the MaputoUsungo-Pangola Basin (Swaziland and Mozambique). It is projected 
that by 2025, two of South Africa’s major river basins (the OrangeSenqu and the Limpopo basin) will be under stress, i.e. meaning they 
will have less than 500 cubic metres of water available per person National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 113
annually.xiv The SADC-Protocol establishes a legally-binding 
framework for transboundary water management in the region. 
Within the context of recent water challenges to sustain livelihoods, 
agriculture, mining, industrial and service economies in our country, 
the regional importance of (1) transboundary water management, 
and (2) sustained and enhanced biodiversity and natural 
ecosystems, including wetlands (which are also the bases for viable 
rural livelihoods and tourism) is clearly evident.
• Ecological infrastructure management and collaboration regarding 
risk management and beneficiation associated with identified 
strategic national protected and management areas within SADC is 
of critical importance for South Africa to reach national development 
objectives and international agreements.
The priorities related to supra-national cross-border and regional interrelations can be summarised as follows:
• Facilitation of trade and movement in the SADC trade bloc;
• Strengthening and expansion of South Africa’s role in facilitating
inter-regional trade and providing regional gateways (i.e. our 
core urban regions and nodes) (see NSDF Sub-Frames 2 and 3);
• Protection of strategic regional ecosystems and bio-diversity
through shared management of International Transfrontier Parks; 
and
• Effective and efficient management of cross-border movement, 
service delivery and inter-regional migration.

5.3 NSDF Sub-Frame Two: National System of 
Nodes and Corridors
5.3.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance 
Settlement development, both in urban and rural South Africa, must be 
undertaken in such a way that it (1) increases development density, (2) 
reduces urban sprawl, (3) prevents the unsustainable use of productive 
land, and (4) optimises investment in infrastructure networks (see Figure 
41).
Inclusive economic development, livelihoods, land and housing: In 
accordance with this objective, municipalities, supported by provincial 
and national government sector departments, must:
• Prepare and implement appropriate local and regional 
economic interventions;
• Enable and support a wide spectrum of livelihood opportunities;
• Ensure timeous identification, acquisition and release of welllocated land; and
• Make provision for a diverse range of housing options for a diverse 
range of household types.xv
In rural settlements, it is imperative that (1) environmentally-sensitive 
settlement planning be undertaken, (2) ‘rural design’ be introduced, and 
(3) viable, new agri-eco-focussed enterprises be established and existing 
ones supported.
Social services and settlements: If South Africa is to meet the social needs 
of its very young, but also increasingly older population, then a rational 
process of providing social infrastructure is required. The NSDF is therefore
underpinned by a ‘national settlement service provision framework 
system’ in terms of which social services are provided in accordance with 
the (1) role and (2) service-reach of the type of settlement on the 
national settlement network. This system provides the basis for guiding 
investment in infrastructure and social services, especially by national 
sector departments (see Figure 42). However, this system will only work if 
government as a whole adopts it to guide its social infrastructure 
planning and investment. As a starting point, it is recommended that 
priority be given to embedding this system in all of government.
National and regional connectivity: The national network of nodes, 
smaller settlements and corridors requires that (1) national nodes and 
smaller settlements are well-connected to each other, and (2) national 
nodes are well-connected to the rest of the world though a range of 
transport modes and communications networks. This requires that:
• Road and rail routes that are of national importance be built, 
maintained and upgraded, as and where necessary;
• Rail be prioritised over road for freight movement; and
• The availability, affordability, safety and quality of mass public 
passenger transport be drastically improved.
Water availability: Given our dire water situation, water demand must be 
curbed, water sources must be augmented, and the little water we have, 
protected from loss through well-maintained infrastructure. In addition to 
this, (1) our ecological infrastructure must be protected and its use be 
well managed, and (2) new settlement development must be restricted 
and existing settlement growth carefully managed in water-stressed 
catchments and regions.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 115

5.3.2 National System of Nodes: Spatial Development and Investment Priorities
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
National Urban Regions (see Figure 41)
• Consolidate urbanisation in compact, productive, sustainable, inclusive and well-governed urban core 
regions.
• Prioritise infrastructure maintenance to mitigate against the expected impact of natural and climate 
change-related hazards on large numbers of people, especially the poor and most vulnerable members of 
society, and avoid repetitive infrastructure-repair costs.
• Manage demand and maintain, expand and refocus our infrastructure network, to enable and sustain bulk 
water supply and energy distribution within and to urban regions.
• Effectively utilise, protect and manage high-value agricultural lands, ecological infrastructure and national 
manmade and natural environmental assets, and mitigate down-stream impacts on water bodies, water 
catchments and other natural resources.
• Actively support national and international programmes aimed at climate change mitigation of CO2-
emissions, and introduce local policies and measures to assist such programmes.
• Utilise innovation, enterprise development and job creation opportunities in (1) agro-eco-industries, (2) 
tertiary and service sectors, (3) tourism, (4) knowledge-creation, and (5) cultural and entertainment industries.
• Maintain and upgrade road and rail routes in urban regions. Prioritise rail for bulk freight, and improve the 
affordability of intercity public passenger transport.
Strengthen and Consolidate Existing Urban 
Regions, i.e.:
• The Gauteng Urban Region;
• The eThekwini Urban Region; and
• The Cape Town Urban Region.
National Urban Nodes (see Figure 41)
• Consolidate and direct the rapid population growth in the eastern half of the country to national urban 
nodes, clusters and corridors by creating (1) quality human settlements, and (2) centres of human capital 
excellence, innovation, trade, inclusive green economies and regional enterprises, and in the process 
reaping the urban dividend.
• Within distressed and sparsely populated areas and areas that are becoming increasingly more arid, 
consolidate settlement growth in (1) existing large urban nodes, and (2) emerging and fast-growing urban 
nodes.
• In addition to strengthening and consolidating expected population growth in range of urban regions, and 
existing cities and intermediary cities, proactively support the development and emergence of a number of 
new cities in identified densely populated and high potential transformation corridors.
Strengthen Existing Urban Nodes, e.g.:
• Mbombela, Richards Bay, Buffalo City and 
Mangaung in existing and identified growth
corridors.
Support Urban Nodes Under Stress, e.g.:
• Kimberley and Rustenburg in economically 
declining regions
Develop New/Emerging Urban Nodes, e.g.:
• Support emergence of new cities Mthatha, 
Hazyview, Tzaneen and Lephalale.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 117
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
National Network of Regional Development Anchors (see Figures 41 and 42)
• Prioritise and strengthen strategically located regional development anchor towns in productive rural regions 
and priority national development, trade and transport corridors to provide (1) a range of services within the 
specific towns/cities and surrounding network of settlements and productive rural regions (see Figures 40 and 
41 and Annexure B for a list of towns and cities). 
• Support and strengthen strategically located regional development anchors through (1) targeted settlement 
planning and development, (2) higher-order social infrastructure provision, and (3) focused support for small 
and medium-sized enterprise development, industrialisation and economic diversification. 
• Use the investment and enhanced social service provision (see Figure 42) in regional development anchors 
to encourage officials working in these rural regions to stay in these settlements and contribute to the local 
economy, instead of commuting to larger towns or cities on a daily or weekly basis.
• Clearly identify the role of specific settlements as gateways and interchanges on the regional public 
transportation network, and incorporate these as such into the planning of functional rural regions.
• Strengthen the connectivity of traditional areas and rural settlements with (1) higher-order urban settlements, 
and (2) economic systems in functional rural regions, by making use of the road and rail network and regional 
corridor development.
• Plan social infrastructure provision within a regional-rural setting using the ‘social services wheel’, and use 
such investment to establish and create well-functioning, compact, lively, rural settlements and regional rural 
systems (see Figure 42 and Annexure B).
Strengthen and Consolidate Existing Regional 
Development Anchor Towns, e.g.:
• Nodes on strategic routes, e.g. Harrismith, 
Estcourt and Clanwilliam; and
• Bigger nodes in denser regions, e.g. 
Phalaborwa, George and Mossel Bay.
Support Regional Development Anchors 
under stress, e.g.:
• In fast-growing towns with extended service 
delivery demands in densely-developed 
border regions, e.g. Musina, Pongola, 
Mmabatho, Mokopane, Tzaneen and 
Makhado;
• In nodes requiring consolidation and 
management support in arid, 
environmentally vulnerable regions, e.g. 
Upington and Kuruman;
• In nodes on strategic national routes, e.g. 
Beaufort West and Vryburg; and
• In smaller nodes in sparsely populated 
regions, e.g. Springbok and Calvinia that 
serve a large hinterland.
Create New/Transform towns into Regional 
Development Anchors e.g.:
• Towns in National Transformation Corridors, 
e.g. Giyani, Thohoyandou, Bushbuckridge, 
Mahikeng, Kuruman, Jozini, Ulundi, Kokstad
and Butterworth.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 118
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
National Network of Rural Service Centres (see Figure 41)
• Rural development must be supported though a hierarchical network of prioritised service centres (see Figure 
42 and Annexure B) where people in rural areas and settlements can optimally be provided with core 
municipal services, social and government services, and where rural logistics and support can be provided 
to optimally support rural development.
• Towns that act as border and trade posts need special attention.
• In arid areas and areas experiencing a decline in population, settlements must be consolidated and 
maintenance prioritised in such core towns.
• In dense rural settlement regions, consolidation within nodal centres and rural design is required.
Strengthen and Consolidate Existing Service 
Centres, e.g.:
• Towns and border and trade posts such as
Manguzi, Komatipoort, Ladybrand and 
Kamaqhekeza.
Support Service Centres in Stressed Regions, 
e.g.:
• Victoria West, Carnarvon, Groblershoop and 
Koffiefontein.
Create New Service Centres and Transform 
Existing Settlements:
• Settlements in dense rural settlement 
regions, e.g. Barkley East, Bizana, Dundee, 
Madibogo and Flagstaff.
Other Smaller Towns and Settlements in South Africa
• Consolidate and provide basic services to the local population in a network of small towns and settlements 
(see Annexure B for a list of these towns). 
• Urban consolidation and basic service delivery in growing regions must keep pace with population growth 
and economic development.
• In densely populated and growing rural regions, (1) settlement must be consolidates in nodes and (2) 
spatial planning and rural design done to ensure managed and quality future settlement development.
• Specific support must be provided to (1) towns that act as border towns and trade posts, and (2) growing 
towns in border regions,
• In areas that are ecologically-sensitive and that experience harsh climatic conditions, new settlement must 
be discouraged.
• In arid areas and areas experiencing a decline in population, settlements must be consolidated and 
maintenance prioritised in the core towns.
• Mining development must be decoupled from settlement development.
Strengthen and Consolidate Existing Towns,
e.g.:
• Service Towns: Modjadjiskloof, Maclear, 
Marblehall and Paul Pietersburg; and 
• Trade posts and growing towns in border
regions, e.g. Alldays, Clarens, Maluti and
Rhodes.
Support Towns in Stressed Regions, e.g.:
• Areas experiencing a decline in population,
e.g. Reivilo, Sannieshof, Pofadder.
Develop New Towns and Transform Existing 
Dense Settlements:
• In dense growing rural regions, e.g. Qumbu 
and Pomeroy.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 119

5.3.3 National Urban Development Corridors and Growth Regions: Spatial Development and Investment Priorities
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Development within National Coastal Corridors (see Figure 41)
• The Coastal Growth and Development Corridor along the eastern and south coasts (N2) is supported as an 
area of strong interconnection between high-value rural resource production, ecological resource regions, 
popular tourist destinations, comfortable climatic zones and urban nodes. 
• This corridor also provides opportunities for the consolidation of existing cities and the development of ‘new’ 
cities supported by well-developed multi-modal connectivity infrastructure. This requires that: 
o Port and airport development be strengthened in support of inter-regional trade flows and efficiency; 
and
o Small harbour development in support of the fishing, tourism and maritime economy at identified coastal 
regional development anchor and rural service centres be maintained, expanded and accelerated.
Strengthen and Consolidate Existing 
Corridors:
• The KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Corridor (Port 
Shepstone to Richards Bay); and
• The Garden Route (Mossel Bay to Nelson 
Mandela Bay).
Development within National Transformation Corridors (see Figure 41)
• Consolidate settlement development and support the development of new cities in areas (1) of significant 
population growth, and (2) that are facing significant challenges and offer sizeable opportunities for 
transformation.

5.3.4 National Action and Key Role
-Players
Strategic investment in national urban growth regions will require (1) high 
levels of intergovernmental coordination and alignment, as well as (2) 
the introduction of ‘joint national spatial accountability’ in terms of the 
achievement of national spatial development outcomes. Crucial actions 
that will have to be undertaken in these regards are the following: • Urban areas experiencing large-scale urbanisation will need (1) the 
support of initiatives such as the IUDF and the DHS’s 
long
-
term 
housing 
plans, with a focus on ensuring financial viability in human settlement 
development, and (2) regional
-scale collaboration
, with a focus on
private sector, civil society and city government involvement
;
• Coordination will need to be done between long
-term infrastructure 
planning, implementation and maintenance, with a specific focus on 
(1) national water storage, allocation and 
availability, and (2) the 
national rail and road network, which necessitates harmonisation 
between IPAP, NATMAP 2050 and the NSDF
;
• Capacity shortfalls in the construction, maintenance and upgrading 
of bulk water, energy and transport infrastructure at local level will 
require dedicated support from the national and provincial 
departments responsible for municipal and spatial planning, with care having to be taken to ensure that such support assists in the 
creation and maintenance of resilient and sustainable 
urban 
regions; 
and 
• Urban land reform and the timeous release of suitable land in the right 
places must be done, which may require the provision of support to 
municipalities with (1) the identification, acquisition and release of 
such land, and (2) the use of such land in ensuring catalytic 
development, spatial transformation and inclusive growth.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 123
5.4 NSDF Sub-Frame Three: National Resource 
Economy Regions
5.4.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance 
Spatial development and investment directives and identified national 
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national 
resource economy regions (see Figure 43) are outlined below. 
Rural regions and regional development anchors: The development of 
productive, functional rural regions throughout South Africa requires:
• The development of viable, robust and resilient regional rural 
economies that recognise and respect the limitations and 
interdependencies of the national ecological infrastructure and 
natural resources on which they depend; 
• The (1) ‘delineation’ of functional rural regions, and (2) the 
identification of regional development anchors in such regions 
that are located on the national transport network;
• High levels of (1) national-regional connectivity between such 
regional development anchors, and urban nodes and regions,
and (2) regional-local connectivity between such anchors and 
the towns and villages in their respective regions; and
• Sound spatial planning, consolidation of the urban development,
and minimisation of the urban footprint, in such regions.
Diversity, strengths and cautions: While the concept of regional rural 
development is a generic one, the spaces in which it is to be utilised are 
far from that. When considering the diverse endowments and assets of 
these rural regions, it emerges that:
• The eastern half of the country has areas with moderate to high 
levels of ‘agricultural potential’:
o Although agriculture has been developed in many of the 
areas where this potential exists, there still remain areas of 
high-agricultural potential that have not yet been fully 
utilised; and
o At the same time, there are also significant areas of dense 
human settlement on high-value agricultural land;
• The western half of the country has less agricultural potential, 
primarily due to far less annual rainfall in these areas than in the 
eastern half of the country:
o Regions in this half of the country do, however, have a 
range of other opportunities, notably tourism, 
conservation and mineral-resource extraction;
• Both halves (east and west) hold most of the key national ground 
and surface-water production areas that are critical for water 
supply to the country’s major urban regions, cities and towns, 
and, as such, this necessitate spatial planning, wise use of natural 
resources and effective land use management; and
• A number of key national conservation areas also feature 
prominently in the areas identified as productive rural regions, 
and although some communities already do benefit from these 
resources, much more can be gained from this relationship, 
notably in the area of eco-tourism and management of 
ecological infrastructure.
Sustainable resource use and land-use management: Intergovernmental 
cooperation and collaboration in (1) the development of productive 
rural regions, and (2) the management of natural resource use in such 
regions will be required. This is especially important in municipalities with 
significant parcels of high-value agricultural land that are under pressure 
from human settlement and/or mining. The focus of such collaboration, National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 124
which should have a (1) spatial planning, (2) land use management and 
(3) inclusive growth component, must at least be on
:
•
Water 
security, including the mitigation of the impacts of regional 
rural development on national water resource availability and 
quality
;
•
Food 
security, including (1) the sustainable use of high
-value 
agricultural land
, and (2) the protection of national food 
production areas
; and
• Land reform, including (1) the pursuit of justice in access to high
-
value agricultural land
, and (2) the provision of support to new 
and emerging farmers in such areas
.
Climate change adaptation
: Climate change 
i
n the form of (1) less rain, 
(2) greater unpredictability in rainfall, (3) higher temperatures, (4) more 
very hot days
, and (5) a greater risk of veld
-fires
, has far
-reaching 
implications for agricultural produce and habitation in all of South 
Africa’s productive rural regions. Even in regions where the impacts of 
climate change will be less severe, the more severe impacts in other 
regions will lead to increased pressure on the use of land and other 
natural resources in such ‘less severely affected regions’.
In order to counter and mitigate the impacts of climate change, 
innovative agricultural adaptation, involving a
move to (1) agricultural 
commodities that are more resistant to extreme and harsh conditions, 
and (2) agricultural practices that are better suited to the anticipated 
adverse climatic conditions, will be required. At the same time, climate 
change may open up opportunities for new economic activities in some 
regions, notably in the area of solar energy generation

5.4.2 National Resource Economy Regions: National Spatial Development and Investment Priorities
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Resource Production Heartland (see Figure 43)
• Protection of high-value agricultural land through the use of ‘rural edges’ at the interfaces 
of regional rural regions with urban regions and nodes (see Annexure B) and the 
management of competing land uses.
• Protection of high-value agricultural land, putting it to good use, and managing competition 
for development on such land, within the pursuit of (1) national food security, (2) economic 
growth, and (3) social stability.
• Management of the development of land with high-agricultural production potential, and 
encouragement of small-scale agriculture and resource enterprise development.
Strengthen the Existing Activities in Productive Rural Regions:
• In the ‘Central Heartland Region’ located around the 
Gauteng, North-West, Mpumalanga and Limpopo 
Agriculture, Mining and Densely-Settled Urban Region.
Support Stressed Rural Regions:
• Intensive rehabilitation and strict control will be required in 
mining areas to limit water, air and soil pollution and land 
degradation;
• The use of renewable and clean energy in coal mining 
regions will need to be incentivised; and
• Regional Economic Innovation will need to be undertaken 
to mitigate the impact of declining demand and 
employment in mining areas in the areas around Gauteng
and the Platinum Mining Belt.
Create New and Transform Existing Productive Rural Regions: 
•Support and encourage urban agriculture and intensive 
agri-enterprise production in cities, towns and urban regions.
Agri-Enterprise Regions (see Figure 43)
• Productive use of high value agricultural land to support national food security.
• Rehabilitation of degraded land and effective land-use management.
• Improvement of rural-to-rural connections, market accessibility and key agriculturalproduction infrastructure.
• Enhancement of connectivity through well-planned infrastructure investment and 
settlement consolidation in well-connected regional development anchors. 
Strengthen Existing Productive Rural Regions:
• Productive use of high-value agricultural land to support 
national food security.
Create New and Transform Existing Productive Rural Regions:
• Focus on the densely-settled Eastern and Northern Region in 
the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo Provinces;
and
• Improve rural-rural and urban-rural connectivity.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 127
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Arid Agri-Region (see Figure 43)
• This arid area has extensive agricultural activities, with (1) pockets and stretches of intensive 
irrigation-farming, (2) mining clusters, (3) renewable energy farms/plants, and (4) small, 
compact settlements.
• The impact of climate change in the already drier and hotter western parts of the country 
(where large areas of locally-significant agricultural activities from an (1) economic activity 
and (2) job-provision perspective are located) will require regional agricultural adaptationsupport and effective land use management. 
• Innovative farming techniques and technologies must be introduced and supported in 
selected arid and semi-arid areas of the country, by making wise and smart use of 
groundwater and/or water transfers.
• Regional development initiatives to share capacity, research and innovation in support of 
innovative regional development must be encouraged.
Support Stressed Rural Regions:
• A good example of this is the Nama-Karoo Regional SDF 
Initiative and the intensive multi-stakeholder engagement 
and collaboration around it.
Strengthen Existing Productive Rural Regions 
• Strengthen, use and expand on existing irrigation schemes, 
innovative farming practices and tourism activities.
Create New and Transform:
•‘Irrigation innovation areas’ that make wise use of existing 
and new dams, irrigation schemes and canals must be 
designed and introduced as a matter of urgency. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 128
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Eco-Resource Production and Livelihood Regions (see Figure 43 and 
Annexure B)
• Enhance (1) the productive capacity, (2) environmental and livelihood quality, (3) cultural
heritage, and (4) natural resource-access of these regions through effective agrarian 
practices and enterprise development programmes that are focussed on natural resource
restoration and custodianship.
• Discourage further land and settlement development, and carefully manage existing 
settlements and land uses in productive agricultural regions that play a crucial role in 
national strategic water production, national food security and rural livelihoods.
• Pursue effective management and custodianship of national strategic water source 
production regions.
• Ensure efficient rural-to-rural connectivity in rural regions, to enhance the prospects of 
making a life in these areas.
• Rehabilitate degraded land and ensure effective land use management, settlement 
consolidation, improved rural connectivity and an eco-resource related enterprise focus, to 
(1) provide opportunities for livelihoods and industry development, and (2) support national 
water availability.
• Enhance and further expand the value and contribution of the Oceans’ and Aqua 
Economy Areas to (1) local livelihoods and regional, and (2) national economic 
development.
Support Stressed Rural Regions:
• The Southwestern Region (i.e. the Western Cape) where
changing climatic conditions will (1) significantly impact on 
national food production and (2) require regional agricultural 
adaptation and effective land use management;
• The Central (Gauteng and Limpopo) Regions where 
nationally significant water and food production are 
impacted by human settlement and mining activities, and 
require effective land-use management;
• The Northern KwaZulu-Natal Region (the Umkhanyakude DM), 
with nationally and regionally significant protected areas; 
and
• The Eastern Drakensberg Region including the Natal Midlands
and extending into Mpumalanga along the Eastern 
Escarpment.
Create New and Transform:
• The densely-settled Eastern and Northern Regions (Eastern 
Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo);
• The arid region on the western border of the Northwest 
Province extending into the Northern Cape; and
• The eastern border of the central high-productive value 
agricultural land and Central Heartland Region.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 129
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Mining and Energy Production Areas and Supportive Infrastructure
• Collaborative, long-term regional development in new mining exploration areas is required, 
which includes (1) scenario development, (2) population migration projections, (3) 
diversification strategies, (4) cost/benefit-modelling of regional infrastructure provision, 
municipal service delivery, and the cumulative impacts of the mining activities, and (5) the 
optimisation of regional and local development opportunities.
• Rehabilitation and negative impact mitigation must extend beyond agreements on paper 
and be enforced on the ground. 
• In the case of new mines, where (1) the levels of automation and mechanisation are low, 
and (2) sizeable numbers of workers will still be required, housing provision and/or settlement 
expansion must take place in regional development anchors or existing small towns where 
adequate social services are available. In deciding on the licencing of such new mining 
operations, (1) national and regional development priorities, and (2) the cumulative impacts 
of the envisaged mining activities and further such activities on the creation of functional 
rural regions must be considered. Where possible, mining companies should become far 
more involved in the development of functional, resilient rural regions, which may include 
investments in (1) hard, transport and connectivity, and (2) soft, social services-infrastructure.
• Limit development of new mining-dependent towns.
• Support and diversify economies in declining mining towns and regions.
Existing Productive Rural Regions to be Strengthened:
• Long-term infrastructure planning must be informed by 
changes in the mining industry;
• Regional development and resource management must be 
used to support further mining and associated activities in 
the northern mining regions; and
• In national urban regions, enterprise opportunities, largescale innovations in service delivery and disruptive 
technologies need to be researched and explored, to 
support urban economies and national well-being.
Support in Stressed Rural Regions:
• The Mpumalanga Coal Mining and Coal Fired Power Plant 
Region will come under increased pressure as a result of (1) 
environmental concerns, (2) a possible decline in the 
demand for coal, and (3) large-scale employment losses, 
which requires regional-scale and industry-orientated 
innovation and the introduction of measures to reduce 
emissions; and
• Within remote and arid regions in the western and northwestern parts of the country, the cumulative impact of a 
growing number of wind farms, solar plants and mining and 
energy-related projects should be carefully evaluated in 
regional context. The growth of existing towns close to these 
areas is supported, but new and on-site settlement far away 
from existing towns is not.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 130
5.4.3 National Action and Key Role-Players
The strategic development of productive rural regions and regional 
development anchors, and the consolidation of regional settlement 
patterns, will require (1) high levels of intergovernmental coordination 
and alignment, as well as (2) the introduction of ‘joint accountability’ in 
terms of the achievement of clearly-defined regional spatial 
development outcomes. Crucial actions that will have to be undertaken 
in these regards are the following:
• Ensuring broad-based support for the regional-rural development
approach, and sustained, active collaboration by national and 
provincial sector departments, traditional leaders, municipalities, 
the private sector and communities in (1) undertaking the 
necessary regional-rural planning and related long-term 
infrastructure investment, (2) tying-in key settlement development 
plans and initiatives, such as the IUDF, the DHS’s long-term housing 
plans, and municipal IDPs and SDFs to these regional-rural plans, 
(3) implementing the plans in a coordinated and integrated 
manner, (4) monitoring the implementation of the plans, and (5) 
building the necessary capacity to undertake such regional rural 
planning and development; and
• Supporting national food security through the protection and 
productive use of high-value agriculture land, as identified and 
directed by DAFF, and ensuring that all relevant national and 
provincial sector departments and municipalities account for 
their use and management of high-value agricultural land; and
• Pursuing and assisting with initiatives aimed at regional economic 
diversification and transition in mining-dependent areas, which 
may involve (1) scenario development, (2) research, (3) piloting 
of proposals, and (4) the provision of enterprise development and 
support, and entail the involvement of a wide range of roleplayers, including the mining industry, organised labour, 
municipalities, traditional leaders, SALGA, universities and 
research councils.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 131
5.5 NSDF Sub-Frame Four: National Movement 
and Connectivity Infrastructure System
5.5.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance 
Spatial development and investment directives and identified national 
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national 
connecting and movement infrastructure (see Figure 44) are outlined 
below. 
Long-term planning and investment: Given the high costs and long lifecycles involved in large scale infrastructure investment, timeous planning, 
evaluation and design of appropriate geo-specific national economic 
infrastructure is critical. Transitions in (1) national settlement patterns, (2)
major economic activities and sectors, (3) climate change, and (4) 
technological advances, notably in transport, energy generation and 
communication networks need to be planned for well in advance, and 
modes and patterns of infrastructure investment adjusted accordingly. 
These actions require (1) the phasing of new connections and extensions,
and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, and (2) the initiation of 
collaborative long-term planning with regards to national and interregional land and sea-based connecting and enabling infrastructure. 
Movement and connection infrastructure networks: These networks are 
fundamental to (1) national spatial development, (2) the utilisation of 
national economic opportunities, (3) the creation of a national system of 
national urban cores, smaller settlements and national spatial 
development corridors, and (4) international, continental and SADC 
trade and connectivity. The effective functioning of these networks 
requires that:
• Investment in rail is prioritised over road for economic, ecological and 
efficiency reasons;
• Rail infrastructure is rehabilitated and expanded to support national 
freight movement and trade with SADC;
• All the roads in the core national network are appropriately surfaced 
and the key routes prioritised for regular maintenance;
• Logistics hubs, ports (airports and harbours) and border posts are 
maintained and expanded, as and where necessary, to keep pace 
with national economic growth and reduce delays at ports; and
• ICT networks are extended to the whole country with national 
corridors, urban regions, cities, regional development anchors, and 
rural service centres being prioritised, and the rest of the country 
incrementally covered over time.
Energy-transmission networks: Maintenance of the national electricity 
grid infrastructure is crucial and timeous expansion of the network must 
be done as and where required from a national development 
perspective. Where new sources of energy are to be introduced to the 
national energy mix, the following should be observed:
• Solar and wind: Production is to be located in close proximity to the 
national grid or users, and in distributed networks in low-density 
areas/small remote towns where it should be delivered though smallscale distributed networks;
• Nuclear: Nuclear power stations must be located in close proximity 
to large water bodies (for cooling) and the existing national 
distribution network; and
• Gas: Gas pipelines must be spatially located in such a way that they 
do not encumber, but support national economic development.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 132

Inter-Regional and National Development Corridors (Road and Rail)
(see Figure 44)
• Adequately plan for and enable trade with SADC, which includes (1) a focus on SADC 
corridors, and (2) improving cost and efficiency at border and port facilities to handle 
greater international and regional trade flows.
• Ensure that all the roads in the core national network are appropriately surfaced and the 
key routes prioritised for regular maintenance.
• Logistics hubs, ports (airports and harbours) and border posts are maintained and 
expanded, as and where necessary, to keep pace with national economic growth and 
reduce delays at ports.
Maintain and Strengthen Existing National Development 
Corridors:
• The N4-Maputo Corridor between Gauteng and Maputo;
• The N4-west, leading to the Trans Kalahari-corridor, and 
passing through Botswana and Namibia to the port of Walvis 
Bay;
• The National routes in South Africa from Gauteng to the 
Durban port (N3);
• The N1 north from Gauteng to Musina and the Beitbridge 
border into Zimbabwe;
• The N1 south from Gauteng to Cape Town; and
• The N2 Coastal Corridor.

• Investment in rail is prioritised over road for economic, ecological and efficiency reasons.
• Rail infrastructure is rehabilitated and expanded to support national freight movement and 
trade with SADC.
Maintain and Strengthen Existing National Development 
Corridors:
• Existing national and inter-regional freight and development 
corridors along significant export and import trade routes, 
from Gauteng (1) via the N4 to Komatipoort, (2) via the N3 to 
eThekwini, and (3) via the N1 north to Musina.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 134
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance National Spatial Development Priorities 
Access Roads to Service Towns and Hinterland (Rural to Rural) (see Figure 
44)
• Improve rural-urban and rural-rural connections to support rural development, innovation 
and enterprise development though infrastructure investment, access to services, rural 
logistics, market gateways and economic agglomeration.
Existing Connections to be Strengthened and Maintained:
• Maintain existing connectivity between urban regions, 
cities, new cities, regional development anchors, and 
resource production areas in the sparsely populated west, 
and the well-connected southern and central parts of the 
country; and
• Maintain access roads and strategic infrastructure to ensure 
resilience of regional development anchors and rural 
service centres in areas where increased temperature and 
increased flooding, due to climate change, are predicted 
to impact negatively on infrastructure networks.
Create New and Transform:
• Improve rural-rural connectivity in National Transformation 
Corridors, and specifically so in the National Eco-Production
Regions in the eastern and northern parts of the country.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 135
5.5.3 National Action and Key Role
-Players
The maintenance, expansion and upgrading of the country’s national 
transport and communications network will require coordination and 
collaboration by a variety of role
-players, notably the 
NDoT, the DMR, 
the DoE, the 
DWS, the NPC, the PICC, ESKOM, SANRAL, PRASA, 
provincial 
sector departments responsible for long term infrastructure planning 
and development, municipalities, mining companies, organised labour 
and community representatives
. The huge costs involved in such 
maintenance, expansion and upgrading, 
and the many other pressing 
development needs may lead to it being neglected. Ways in which 
timeous planning, budgeting and investment can be secured are as 
follows: • Preparing a long
-term national infrastructure plan that is aligned with 
the NSDF
, (1) using the appropriate scenario development 
modelling techniques, (2) with involvement of a wide range of role
-
players and interest groups, including communities, and (3) introducing a phased approach to spread the cost of time;
• Creating a broad
-based awareness 
o
f national and supra
-national 
interdependencies and the need for investing in the network;
• Building the necessary capacities amongst the key role
-players;
• Introducing a coordinating and monitoring institution, and providing 
regular updates as to the state of the network; and
• Using the NSDF’s envisaged 
‘national spatial accountability system’ 
to monitor the contribution of key role
-players in the maintenance, 
expansion and upgrading of the network in accordance with the 
national plan

Frame Five: National Ecological 
Infrastructure and Natural Resource System
5.6.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance
Spatial development and investment directives and identified national 
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national
ecological infrastructure and natural resource system
(see Figure 4
5) are 
outlined below. Protecting the national 
ecological 
infrastructure and natural resource
system
: This 
‘system’ provides a natural resource foundation that enables 
all human life and activities in the country, and must, as such, be wisely 
used, managed and protected. 
It includes areas regarded as strategic 
assets within the country’s national and international biodiversity, 
ecology and tourism areas (including Ramsar Sites and Transfrontier Parks). The protection of this system requires that: • National spatial development is well-planned and well-managed 
to (1) limit negative impact
s on the ecological infrastructure 
system
, (2) ensure that urban growth and land use fits within 
national and regional water resource availability profiles, and (3) 
ensure that land and/or settlement development does not 
threaten or compromise strategic surface and groundwater 
water production areas (see Annexure B
)
;
• National water use is curbed through effective water demand 
management, recycling, infrastructure maintenance and water 
augmentation projects; and
• The strategic national water resource infrastructure system is well
-
maintained and the 
restoration of degraded water areas is 
prioritised

5.6.2 National Ecological Infrastructure and Natural Resource System: National Spatial Development and Investment Priorities
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance: National Spatial Development Priorities 
National Protected Areas (see Figure 45)
• Protect national ecological resources and national heritage areas.
• National spatial development is well-planned and well-managed to enable protection, as well as 
the effective use and beneficiation of national protected areas in accordance with the relevant 
regulations.
Maintain and Strengthen the Full Range of Priority 
Protected Areas:
• Transfrontier Parks;
• Major National and Provincial Parks;
• National Fresh Water Protection Areas; and 
• Marine Protected Areas.
Support Development in Stressed Regions:
• The N2 from Nelson-Mandela Bay via Mthatha to 
Port Shepstone; and
• The N2 from Richards Bay to Pongola.
Create New and Transform:
• The ecologically-sensitive area from Mbombela to 
Makhado and Polokwane.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 139
Spatial Development and Investment Guidance: National Spatial Development Priorities 
National Ecological and Biodiversity Management Areas (see Figure 45)
• Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) have been identified 
as Priority National Ecological Infrastructure Regions that are of national importance and 
development. 
• Management, productive use and restoration of these areas (1) is a joint responsibility, and (2) 
could also be used for the socio-economic benefit of people, cities and economies in the regions 
in which they are located. 
• Land-uses that reduce run-off or stream flow, or affect water-quality (e.g. mining, plantations, 
crop production and overgrazing) should be avoided in SWSAs, wetlands should be kept in good 
condition or rehabilitated, and invasive alien plants should be cleared. To support this:
• The natural resource foundation and bio-diversity must be conserved in these areas of 
national and international significance; and 
• CBAs should remain in natural or near-natural ecological condition, i.e. no intensive land uses 
should take place in these areas (see Annexure B).
• ‘Developmental co-benefits’ must be created through effective management and use of 
strategic ecological and biodiversity management areas, to support rural livelihoods, especially 
with regards to custodianship and tourism opportunities.
Maintain and Strengthen the Full Range of Priority 
Protected Areas:
• Manage and protect national protected areas; and
• Manage the use and restoration of relevant waterbodies and water production areas. 
Support Stressed Areas:
• Effective land development management and 
productive development of CBAs and SWSAs in EcoUrban Resource Production and Livelihood Regions 
(i.e. densely-settled smallholder farming and 
livelihood regions);
• Strategic Ground and Surface Water Production 
Areas have been identified, but must still be formally 
delineated and proclaimed;
• SWSAs need to be effectively restored, used and 
managed to support enterprise and livelihood 
opportunities and eco-industrial activities; and
• Existing and new economic activities must adhere to 
national development and management guidelines 
that have been (and are being) developed.
Create New and Transform:
• Effective land-use management and productive 
development of CBAs and SWSAs in dense clusters of 
urban, agricultural, industrial and mining areas in the

• Management of settlement growth in areas that are 
arid and increasingly under pressure in terms of wateravailability, which may even include restrictions on 
further growth should water-availability not improve.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 141
5.6.3 National Action and Key Role
-Players
Regulatory implementation with regards to 
SWSAs is imperative. While 
guidelines for the management of development in such areas have 
been prepared, further actions have to be taken to see them 
implemented, i.e. (1) an intergovernmental team led by DEA and SANBI
has to be put together, (2) awareness of the guidelines must be raised, 
and (3) the guidelines must be finalised and promulgated
. In the interim, 
awareness of these guidelines can and needs to be raised, specifically 
with regards to: • Activities such as (1) agriculture, (2) mining, (3) land and settlement 
development, (4) infrastructure investment
, and (5) spatial planning
and land use management in areas experiencing significant 
development pressure
s, such as the 
three National Transformation 
Corridors; and
• Category 1 of the CBAs
, and the implications of this ‘CBA
-status’ for 
land development and land use management in such areas. 
With regards to 
‘national spatial accountability
’ for the protection of 
environmental quality in 
(1) SWSAs, (2) CBAs: Category 1, and (3) 
National Fresh Water Protection Areas, provinces responsible for the 
management of these area
s
, and their upstream impacts, will have to 
account for their actions. In addition to this, provincial and municipal 
SDFs must ensure that development in such key ecological areas is (1) 
not to their detriment, and (2) enhances their ability to provide their 
crucial life
-enabling and ecological support services
. The 
capacity, 
monitoring and support
-implications of these roles and duties are 
significant, and will need to be jointly attended to by the national sector 
departments responsible for environmental affairs and spatial planning
.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 142
5.7 National Spatial Action Areas
5.7.1 Introduction
Following on from the directive in the NDP, the NSDF identifies areas of 
significant national risk and potential. In sharp contrast to the centrifugal
forces (i.e. ‘outward-pushing forces away from the core’) that shaped 
Apartheid national spatial development planning, the NSDF provides a 
development perspective aimed at ‘drawing all South Africans closer to 
the core’: 
• Nationally, in the form of a shared and smaller, yet more viable, 
more sustainable and more resilient national spatial footprint that 
places less pressure on our core national natural resource areas 
and ecological systems, and is more affordable to service and 
sustain;
• Regionally, in functionally integrated areas focused on regional 
development and wellbeing that (1) are supported by regional 
development collaboration agreements between of State and 
non-State actors, and (2) provide an interface between ‘the 
national and ‘the local; and 
• Locally, in high-quality, serviced, compact, diverse and 
connected places with viable, robust and resilient economies.
In order to create such a ‘shared, smaller, better connected and more 
sustainable South Africa’, the NSDF identifies the most urgent short-term, 
strategic spatial development catalysts to (1) bring about radical spatial 
transformation at scale, (2) manage and mitigate rising national risks, and 
(3) move our country at speed towards the Ideal National Spatial 
Development Pattern (see Figure 46). These are called National Spatial 
Action Areas (NSAAs) (see Figure 47)
Concerted, focused and sustained intergovernmental collaboration is 
required in these NSAAs (see Table 1) in the short term to:
• Target national spatial development actions and interventions;
and 
• Kickstart the process of aligning plans, budgets and 
departmental plans in and between spheres of government 
around national spatial development priorities.
The selection of the five types of NSAAs was informed by:
• The challenges and trends that are most likely to impact our 
country over the course of the (1) immediate, and (2) medium 
and longer-term futures; 
• The stated development objectives in national and provincial 
development and sector plans; and
• The gap between our national spatial development vision and 
the status quo.
The identification of the NSAAs does not propose an overhaul or detailed 
spatial alignment of every existing planning instrument or initiative. 
Instead the introduction of these priority areas seeks to impact 
government processes by:
• Identifying (1) urgently required interventions in national space 
and (2) priority spatial development enablers for accelerated 
development impact in this space; and 
• Restoring and managing the sustainable utilization of our 
country’s rich natural resource foundation and ecological 
infrastructure.
In the following sections, the NSAAs are briefly outlined, a few key 
statistics for each of the provided, and key action areas and role-players 
identified. (The statistics were generated by use of the national Mesozone 
data setxvi, with the exception of the population growth scenarios for 2030 
and 2050, for which the Green Bookxvii was used.)National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 143

Figure 48: National Transformation Corridors OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 147
5.7.2.1 Significance of the National Transformation Corridors as 
NSAAs
While these three corridors have their own unique contexts and 
challenges, they share many similarities: They all have (1) large, youthful
populations, (2) shared histories of deep deprivation and neglect as 
former Apartheid Bantustans, (3) high levels of poverty and 
unemployment, and (4) dense and sprawling rural settlement forms. They 
are also areas of high ecological value to the country as (1) surface 
water producers in the case of the National Coastal Transformation 
Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation Corridor, and (2) an 
enormous source of groundwater, in the case of the Northwestern 
Transformation Corridor. In addition to this, the National Coastal 
Transformation Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation 
Corridor include large portions of the country’s very limited high-value 
agricultural land, and as such are key to the long-term food security of 
the country. The Northwestern Transformation Corridor, in turn, includes 
crucial cattle and irrigation farming activities.
In terms of climate change predictions, the National Coastal 
Transformation Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation 
Corridor, will also be called upon to provide (1) water and food, (2) key 
ecosystems services, and (3) a place to call home, due to the relatively 
more favourable climatic conditions in these parts of the country vis-à-vis 
far less favourable conditions envisaged in the western, north-western 
and central parts of the country. In the case of the Northwestern 
Transformation Corridor, the area in which it is located is set to 
experiences very harsh climatic conditions in the not-too-distant future, 
but (1) due to intensive irrigation, farming has become established as a 
regionally and nationally important economic activity, and (2) mining
has a become a earner of foreign exchange for the country. 
Given their shared histories, similar challenges, and importance for the 
future of the country, declaring these areas as NSAAs is crucial, (1) for the 
sake of historical redress, (2) for attending to pressing rural spatial, social 
and economic development challenges at scale, (3) for national food 
and water security, and (4) for realising our desired future Ideal National 
Spatial Development Pattern. Failure to turn the tide on the challenges 
these NSAAs face, and ensuring sustainable (1) service delivery, and (2) 
regional economic development, would not only be to the detriment of 
these areas and the people who live in them, but also the country as a 
whole, due to significant regional interdependencies.
5.7.2.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions
Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF 
Sub-Frames, the following national priorities require strategic spatial 
action to (1) bring about transformation in the national spatial pattern, 
(2) enable national and regional-scale climate and developmental 
adaptation, and (3) achieve developmental impact at scale:
• Extend and improve the transportation networks, ensure regular 
maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure, notably roads,
increase investment in high-speed ICT infrastructure and enhance 
urban-rural and rural-rural connectivity;
• Develop a network of (1) strong and vibrant existing and emerging 
cities and large towns to fulfil the role of fully-fledged national urban 
nodes, (2) viable regional development anchors, and (3) wellcapacitated rural service centres;
• Ensure effective city and town management to prevent sprawl, 
ensure innovative settlement planning and urban land reform, wellmanaged land-use, enabling infrastructure investment.
• Introduce rural design, urban/rural edges, land administration and 
urban land reform, to consolidate place-specific urbanisation in National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 148
dense rural settlements within a strategically located network of rural 
service centres and towns
• Provide catalytic, innovative and contextually-suitable sustainable 
infrastructure, social and basic services to support enterprise
development, well-being and inclusive growth with both an 
ecological and human-focussed approach.
• Prioritise human capital and people-centred enterprise 
development, e.g. arts and culture, tourism, knowledge creation, 
education and innovation;
• Optimise the agricultural opportunities in the region and support the 
establishment of small-scale farming activities, agri-enterprises and 
agri-led industrialisation, to foster productive rural regions, enhance 
national food security, and strengthen national water security;
• Develop the tourism sector and creative industries in the region, with 
an emphasis on small-and-medium-sized farming activities, and 
agri-eco production;
• Ensure the protection and management of ecological infrastructure 
and national resources and protected areas, including SWSAs and 
high-value agricultural land; and
• Establish strong regional growth and development compacts,
including all role-players, i.e. the three spheres of government, 
traditional leaders, communities (notably youth), the private sector, 
CBOs, NGOs and organised labour, and ensure regional, crossprovincial and cross-municipal boundary collaborative spatial 
development planning and governance.

5.7.3 NSAA Two: Central Innovation Belt
Figure 52: Central Innovation Belt OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 154
5.7.3.1 Significance of the Central Innovation Belt as NSAA
The area around the core of the Gauteng urban region is spatially 
positioned to be an economically strong, diverse production area that 
forms an integral part of the core economic driver of the country and 
sub-continent. The Central Innovation Belt is a key contributor to national 
economic growth and employment and a crucial surface water 
production area, i.e. the Vaal Catchment. 
The Central Innovation Belt is characterised by:
• A long history of high-value mining and industrial production that is, 
and has been, experiencing significant shrinkage and job losses in
some parts, with more very likely to come, which is primarily due to 
changes in the demand for resource-based commodities and the 
costs of resource extraction;
• Intensive agriculture and related agro-enterprises, as well as tourism 
activities that are not necessarily at odds, but also not enhanced by 
the mining and industrial activities in the same area;
• Sustained strong natural population growth and in-migration, much 
of it driven by the prospect of employment in the mining and 
industrial sectors;
• High levels of regional economic and socio-economic vulnerability,
due to the economic decline and job losses and uncertainties about
the future of especially mining in the area; and
• Pressures on natural resources, notably productive agricultural land 
and surface water production by population growth, urban sprawl
and pollution.
The eastern part of the Region intersects with another NSAA, i.e. the
Olifants River Catchment in Mpumalanga, which is a National Resource 
Risk area in Mpumalanga, where similar changes in the mining and 
energy-generation sectors, as well as competition for land and water for 
food production require a transition in the regional economy and 
mitigation of environmental risk factors. The Vaal Catchment area covers 
the southern portion of the Region, where severe challenges around 
contamination have been, and are being experienced.
5.7.3.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions
Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF 
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:
• Support large-scale regional economic and employment change in 
the region through innovation, diversification, adaptation and the 
repurposing of existing industrial land and associated infrastructure;
• Expedite urban and rural land reform, consolidate existing small-andmedium-scale agriculture support programmes, protect and 
optimise high-value agricultural land, and strengthen the focus on 
job-intensive agro-processing in the area;
• Introduce a special collaborative programme in government 
(including DMR, DTI, CoGTA, DRDLR, DPME, NT, provincial sector 
department and municipalities) with a specific focus on ensuring (1) 
innovation and economic diversification, and (2) quality human 
settlement development in the region, and involve universities, 
research councils, the private sector, communities and organised 
labour in this urgent initiative; and
• Establish a joint public-private action group to manage the threat to 
nationally and regionally important water and productive land 
resources, with the priority being on the impact of formal and informal 
urban sprawl, acid mine water, the maintenance of productive 
agriculture, especially for small scale farmers close to urban centres,
and the rehabilitation and management of the Vaal system.

5.7.4 NSAA Three: National Resource Risk Areas
Figure 54: National Resource Risk Areas OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 158
5.7.4.1 Significance of the National Resource Risk Areas as NSAAs
These are areas that are of national importance to the economy of the 
country and the lives of its people. They are under severe stress from an 
ecological perspective, while also being ‘resource critical regions’ for 
other economic sectors, such as mining, agriculture and human 
settlement. Water is not only a vital resource in the mining activities that 
drive the energy sector, but also crucial for (1) the strong agricultural 
sector in these areas, and for (2) energy-generation at coal fired power 
plants, i.e. the Olifants, Upper Vaal and Waterberg catchment areas. 
Keeping these economies going, and expanding them further, as is 
currently happening in a number of these catchment areas, (1) poses a 
serious risk to the quantity and quality of the water supplied by these 
areas to the country as a whole, and (2) presents the country with a 
serious conundrum and set of trade-offs. At the moment, however, the 
trade-offs between water, food and energy security in these areas (and 
the knock-on effects in other places) are playing out in a largely ad hoc
way. It is, however, not due to lack of awareness and concern, as 
numerous plans refer to the challenge. The problem is that not much has 
been done to date, with urgent engagement being required with 
regards to the following trade-offs:
• Upper Vaal region (Mpumalanga): Coal mining, energy generation 
SWSAs and high-potential agricultural land;
• Greater uMngeni region (KwaZulu-Natal): Water supply for 
eThekwini, intensive agriculture and expanding settlements;
• Waterberg region (Limpopo): Mining, water, energy generation and 
future expansion of the area driven as a national priority;
• Olifants Water Management Area (Mpumalanga and Limpopo):
Irrigation schemes, major water quality issues, and pressure from 
mining activities and energy generation; and
• Berg and Breede River Catchments (Western Cape): Highproduction agriculture, food security and water supply for the Cape 
Town urban region.
5.7.4.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions
Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF 
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:
• Attend, as a matter of urgency, to areas were land-use and water 
competition and pollution are (1) causing severe risks to stressed 
catchments in fulfilling their roles, and (2) placing downstream 
dependent regions at risk;
• Rehabilitate degraded and/or contaminated areas to play their crucial 
roles in national (1) food production, and (2) surface and ground water 
production and supply; 
• Plan and prepare for climate change, not only in the areas themselves, 
but also for the knock-on effects of climate change in other parts of the 
country and in neighbouring countries;
• Attend to capacity and resource-constraints at provincial, regional and 
local levels, with national sector departments responsible for 
environmental affairs and spatial planning playing a key role in this 
regard;
• Avoid approving applications and proposals for land-uses that reduce 
stream flow or affect water quality (e.g. mining operations and huge 
plantations) in SWSAs;
• Keep wetlands in good condition, rehabilitate ones in need of it, and 
clear invasive alien plants form these areas;
• Restore, manage and wisely use CBAs and SWSAs to support ecoenterprise activities and related livelihood opportunities;
• Prepare an integrated development and resource management plans
with an explicitly (1) spatial approach and (2) a strategic national 
perspective, for each of these areas, possibly a Regional SDF;xviii and
• Ensure coordinated State intervention in these areas, with provincial 
governments, in collaboration with the institution responsible for NSDF 
implementation, spearheading such action.

5.7.5 NSAA Four: National Urban Regions
Figure 60: National Urban Regions OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 167
5.7.5.1 Significance of the National Urban Regions as NSAAs
More than half of the country’s population already live in urban regions 
and cities, with this trend set to continue well into the future. In addition 
to being ‘home’ to millions of our people, three main urban regions are 
also where:
• The bulk of the country’s economic activities, and those economic 
activities of highest value, are concentrated;
• The national transition to a high-value service-based economy will 
be driven and accomplished;
• Prospects for job creation through upstarts, small-scale activities and 
the arts, culture and entertainment industries are greatest;
• The youth dividend must be reaped; and
• The bulk of (1) imports and exports, and (2) tourists visiting the 
country, pass through.
As such, these spaces, small in size, but huge in terms of population, 
economic activity and opportunity, are fundamental to the future of the
country. Powerful as they are, they are struggling to deal with the 
challenges of service provision, housing, unemployment, crime, 
environmental degradation, transport and infrastructure maintenance. I 
addition to this, they also still struggle with the legacy of spatial 
segregation and exclusion.
Due to their economic and social significance, these regions face not 
only natural population growth but also in-migration of people hoping to 
tap into the benefits and opportunities of urban areas. Ensuring not only 
sustainable economic growth, but also spatial transformation and 
inclusive economic growth in these regions will be key contributors to 
realising the desired Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern.
5.7.5.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions
Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF 
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:
• Plan for and undertake infrastructure maintenance at scale, to (1) 
ensure economic vitality, and (2) avoid human health and safety 
risks because of ageing infrastructure, lack of maintenance and 
damage by climate change-related hazards on water, sanitation, 
storm water, transport and electricity networks;
• Develop specific funding, land access, land tenure and service 
provision mechanisms to (1) enable higher residential densities, (2) 
provide a range of housing options, (3) alleviate pressure on basic 
and social service provision, (4) optimise urban land reform
dividends, (5) manage urban growth, and (6) provide effective mass 
public transport;
• Support small-scale farmers in the regions to improve food security 
and employment;
• Support innovation and skills development in growing economic 
sectors, with a focus on youth development and employment at 
scale; 
• Support and maintain key export routes and ports; and
• Prepare for climate change by amongst other measures, initiating 
an in-depth study into the long-term impacts of climate change on 
the core urban areas of the country, and developing mitigation and 
adaptation strategies, e.g. desalination, urban food production, 
and low/no-carbon energy generation, based on the findings of the 
study.

5.7.6 NSAA Five: Arid-Innovation Region
Figure 64: Arid-Innovation Region OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 172
5.7.6.1 Significance of the Arid Innovation Region as NSAA
This region comprises the arid and sparsely populated western and 
southwestern central parts of the country. It is set to be significantly 
affected by future climate change trends, notably (1) higher
temperatures and (2) less rainfall in large parts of the region, requiring a 
consolidated response.
In terms of the key characteristics of region: 
• The towns, their inhabitants, their economies and the economy of 
the wider arid region in which they are located, are under constant 
threat from a limited availability of water; and
• Most of the towns are heavily reliant on a single economic sector, 
typically agriculture or mining. This makes them very vulnerable to 
(1) external factors, such as currency fluctuations, trade disputes 
and changes in the demand for commodities, and (2) more local 
factors, notably climate change in the form of a significant rise in 
temperature, more very hot days, a greater risk of veld fires, and the 
advent of even drier conditions and water shortages.
Due to current challenges and increasing climatic pressures, this region 
requires a range of targeted interventions. This is necessary to ensure the 
future well-being of its inhabitants, the health of its economy and the 
sustainable use of its natural resources. It is also important to harness the 
nationally significant opportunities of this region, including its niche 
agricultural activities and fisheries, mineral deposits, potential for 
alternative energy generation and contribution to the international 
scientific community through the SKA.
5.7.6.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions
Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF 
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:
• Pursue regional adaptation, economic diversification and agriinnovation at scale, to ensure greater resilience of livelihoods in the 
region;
• Limit expansion and development of new settlements in very arid 
areas, and pursue and support compact settlement development 
around social service nodes and taxi routes in towns and villages, 
within assured water availability limits;
• Enhance regional, cross-provincial and cross-municipal boundary 
collaborative spatial development planning and governance;
• Establish strong regional growth and development compacts, 
including all role-players, i.e. the three spheres of government, 
traditional leaders, communities (notably youth), the private sector, 
CBOs, NGOs and organised labour;xix
• Encourage and support inhabitants of such towns to become selfsufficient and ‘go off the gird’ with regards to (1) water, electricity 
and sanitation services, and (2) food production; 
• Enhance ICT linkages, to support distance-learning and provide 
access to other social services; and 
• Discourage new temporary settlement formation for mining or largescale construction projects, e.g. the building of a solar-plant) by 
facilitating housing-provision in closest existing regional 
development anchors and/or regional service towns and support 
with public transport.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 173

5.7.8 National Risk of Non-Action
The NSDF seeks to fundamentally and decisively change and transform 
South Africa from a country shackled by its past, into a truly free and just 
country that offers a (1) decent quality of life, and (2) a fair chance to 
make a life, to all who live in it. To this effect it puts forward a series of 
proposals to bring this transition about, and identified the set of NSAAs, 
as briefly described in Section 5.7.6. Yet, it may be that there is a 
reluctance, slowness or unwillingness to implement the proposals. The 
table below (Table 31) sets out the risks associated with failure to act in
and on the NSAAs. National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 180
Table 31: Risks of Non-Action in/on the NSAAs
HIGH RISKS OF NON-ACTION IN/ON 
STRATEGIC ACTION AREAS RESULTANT IMPLICATIONS
Lack of development management in 
national ecological and biodiversity 
management areas, such as the 
Natural Resource Risk Areas and the 
National Transformation Corridors
• Unmanaged urban growth and land-use resource risk areas and transformation corridors with resultant 
negative impacts on (1) sensitive ecological infrastructure, (2) the tourism sector, and (3) other economic 
opportunities of national significance.
• ‘Running out of water’, which will have detrimental effects on (1) all inhabitants dependant on these 
urban regions, but notably so vulnerable communities, (2) job creation, (3) agriculture and food 
production, and (4) living costs.
• Continued settlement development infiltrating high-value agriculture and strategic national surface 
water production areas.
• Due to the population size and scale of settlement in national urban regions, massive losses of biodiversity 
and crucial ecosystems services for urban regions, the country at large, and the globe.
Lack of action in areas were land-use 
and water bodies and production are in 
competition
• Will most likely cause severe risks to stressed catchments in fulfilling their roles, and place downstream 
dependent regions at risk.
• Could lead to costly pollution and life-threatening toxicity of water bodies and streams with a resultant 
threat to human, plant and animal life and enormous financial expenses to resolve the matter. 
• Failure to manage competitive land use between human settlements, water production and food 
production can result in food and water shortages.
Failure to maintain and improve 
international trade and movement 
infrastructure (routes and ports)
• A loss in South Africa’s competitive advantage with regards to infrastructure.
• Restricting growth and limiting national, SADC, African and global integration.
• An increased burden on road networks if the rail network is not attended to. 
Failure to improve and extend critical 
infrastructure and develop the three
National Transformation Corridors
• Increased sprawl, loss of high-value agricultural land, loss of surface water production areas, an increase 
in joblessness and growing frustration and associated risks to national cohesion and stability.
• A squandering of a real opportunity to turn around the dreadful spatial, social and economic legacies 
of Apartheid in what includes large swaths of former Bantustan areas.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 181
HIGH RISKS OF NON-ACTION IN/ON 
STRATEGIC ACTION AREAS RESULTANT IMPLICATIONS
Lack of future-orientated, nationally 
directed urban growth in areas of 
opportunity
• Urban and settlement growth merely following existing trends (as illustrated through spatial modelling of 
most likely trends without intervention), which will severely reduce our ability to (1) create viable 
livelihoods at scale, (2) threaten our natural resources, and (3) reduce government’s ability to provide 
sustainable services in towns.
• The legacies of the colonial and Apartheid pasts will become even more deeply entrenched across the 
national urban-rural landscape.
• Towns in arid areas with unfavourable climate conditions will become ever-more exposed to risks that 
they will most likely not be able to counter or manage.
Ineffective governance, funding 
shortfalls in the provision of municipal 
infrastructure, and a lack of a nationally 
targeted, systematic, systemic and 
long-term developmental focus on 
large urban areas, towns and national 
development corridors with large urban 
concentrations
• A loss of the opportunity to harness the ‘triple dividend’ of a youthful population, many of whom are 
located in urban areas.
• A serious likelihood of unmanaged urban growth and land-use in coastal areas with devastating effects 
on (1) sensitive ecological infrastructure, and (2) related tourism and economic activities and 
opportunities.
• An increasing inability of even large municipalities to meet the growing demands of a fast-growing 
population, and provide services and sustain environments in which economies can take root and grow, 
leading to (1) outbreaks of disease with associated chronic public health risks, (2) business closures, (3) 
more unemployment and more crime, (5) a loss in the quality of life in urban areas, (6) massive social 
unrest and an increase in xenophobic attacks and violence, (7) the collapse of the Rand and the largescale departure of local and foreign investors, and (8) the mass emigration of millions of especially young 
South Africans.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 182
PART SIX: Implementation FrameworkNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 183
6.1 Introduction
The implementation framework outlines the measures, approach and 
actions required to realising our National Spatial Development Vision in a 
coherent, diligent and systematic way.
The NSDF is aimed at addressing our history of forced removals, spatial 
segregation and unequal spatial investment. This legacy of colonialism 
and Apartheid persists to this day, and leads to the perpetuation of 
inequality, unemployment and poverty. The Apartheid National Spatial 
Development Logic underpinning this legacy has to be disrupted and 
undone, to enable us to bring about a very different future.
Despite much progress having been made since 1994 in (1) the provision 
of basic services, (2) housing delivery, and (3) integrated development 
legislation, policy and planning, the unequal spatial development 
patterns have continued. We have failed to bring about spatial 
transformation, i.e. moving from a segregated, unequal and inefficient 
Apartheid National Spatial Development Pattern to a new, integrated, 
inclusive and sustainable Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern.
The major gap in our transformation effort has been at a strategic spatial 
investment and implementation level, where, despite a sound National 
Development Paradigm including the Constitution, the NDP and a 
progressive legal and policy framework, we have not been able to 
disrupt and overcome colonial and apartheid spatial development 
logics in practice. 
The NDP recognises that it is only through radical and decisive 
intervention that is coherently planned for and managed in the national 
sphere at the national scale, that we stand a chance of disrupting the 
apartheid spatial logic and space economy, and overcoming the 
inequities and distances brought about by colonialism and Apartheid.
The NSDF has been prepared to give effect to the NDP by providing 
national spatial development guidance and direction. As such, the NSDF 
is closing the gap in our transformation effort by changing and 
influencing practice by becoming clearer about (1) the strategic spatial 
development challenges and opportunities across the country, and (2) 
the desired National Spatial Development Outcomes. 
The NSDF’s analysis of National Spatial Development Shapers indicates 
the five key problems emanating from the current national spatial 
development pattern that the country has to address:
• High pressure on natural resources;
• Inequitable use of land;
• High rates of urbanisation with high pressure and expectations of 
adequate housing, basic services and jobs;
• High levels of poverty in the former Bantustan and township areas; 
and 
• A disconnected national spatial pattern where there is misalignment between where economic activity takes place and 
where people live, where natural resources are located, and 
costly infrastructure networks is in place.
The NSDF’s theory of change presents the pathway from the current 
situation to the desired spatial future, and the NSDF by:
• Crafting a strong and credible and Post-Apartheid National 
Spatial Development Vision;
• Articulating a compelling and persuasive Post-Apartheid Spatial 
Development Logic;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 184
• Crafting a desired Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development 
Pattern;
• Setting out interventions and actions that are required to bring 
about the desired Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development 
Pattern; and 
• Providing Implementation Guidance for realising the desired 
national spatial transformation.
As such, and it being positioned alongside and in tandem with the NDP, 
the NSDF, once adopted by Cabinet, will be the Apex Spatial Plan for the 
country, and it will remain so until it is reviewed in the future. This means 
that henceforth all spatial plans, investment and projects in the country 
have to give effect to achieving the NSDF intent and adhere to the NSDF 
Frames and Guidelines.
In order to transcend the “practice gap”, there will be a rigorous focus 
on holding all three spheres of government, sector departments and 
social actors accountable for their (1) planning, (2) investment decisions 
and (3) delivery programmes, according to the extent to which these 
processes advance the objectives of the NDP and the NSDF, and adhere 
to the spatial development guidance and directives of the NSDF.
6.2 Preparing for Success
The successful implementation of the NSDF is dependent on all role 
players within and outside of government understanding the spatial 
guidance and directives, and interpreting, advancing, applying and 
adhering to these. 
The scale of spatial change identified over the 2050-horizon as well as the 
limited window of opportunity to realise the demographic and urban 
dividend, means that there has to be an acceleration towards the 
desired spatial future pathway and outcomes. This will require (1) a 
renewed vigour, belief and urgency, (2) a posture of excellence and 
country success, and (3) retooled and even new capabilities to build an 
inclusive and prosperous society in a far more focused and methodical 
manner. 
The NSDF guides and promotes coordinated work across government 
and society where every national department, state entity, province, 
municipality, civil society organisation, private sector, and the public has 
to:
• Be aware of and appreciate the national spatial transformation 
imperative of the country; 
• Understand and promote the National Spatial Development 
Vision 2050, and commit to realising the vision; and 
• Be accountable for the spatial impact of planning, investment 
and actions as they relate to achieving the Ideal National Spatial 
Development Pattern and the spatial transformation of places. 
The state will lead the process under the framework of the NDP by 
ensuring a cohesive government approach with the NSDF sitting
complementarily to the NDP at the apex of the country’s spatial 
development planning system. The implementation of the NSDF operates
as such within the constitutional framework of the country, as well as 
within the precepts of the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act, 
2005, with regards to coordinating the implementation of national 
priorities, and in furthering the objectives set out in SPLUMA, in particular:
• The NSDF has to indicate the desired patterns of land use in the 
country and guide and direct provincial and municipal SDFs 
accordingly; andNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 185
• The NSDF has to guide planning and development across all 
sectors of the national sphere of government, and contribute to 
a coherent planned approach to spatial development in the 
three spheres of government.
Implementation of the NSDF entails the process of adapting and 
improving the process of development planning across government and 
ensuring that it informs government (corporate/departmental) planning, 
budgeting (investment), delivery and enforcement (spatial 
governance), to achieve the desired national spatial development 
outcomes.
The NDP-NSDF at the apex of the country’s development planning system 
informs the government (or corporate/organizational) planning cycle. 
The development plans (sector strategies, provincial growth and 
development strategies and provincial spatial development frameworks, 
municipal integrated development plans and spatial development 
frameworks) are strategic, integrated and/or sector-wide long-term 
plans, whilst the corporate plans are short-medium term departmental 
plans (national, provincial and municipal) linked to the Medium Term 
Strategic Framework (MTSF) and the annual and three-year multi-year 
budgeting (MTEF) cycle.
The successful implementation of the NSDF will require additional and 
more appropriate capacity to be developed across government for this 
approach to long-term strategic planning, investment have a positive 
spatial development impact on delivery. All departments, state entities, 
provinces and municipalities will have to (1) retool existing capabilities,
and (2) find, or augment capacity for the new task at hand, working 
together with industry, tertiary institutions and professional bodies.
This must also be an opportunity to tap into the agility and resourcefulness 
of young planners and nurture and fast-track young talented planners
who have the passion and drive for making a better future.
6.3 Work Streams
The implementation of the NSDF refers to what in essence are four 
processes running in parallel and these are accordingly arranged into 
four interrelated work streams, i.e.:
• Workstream 1: Championing and Support;
• Workstream 2: Development Planning Alignment;
• Workstream 3: Investment Spending Alignment; and
• Workstream 4: Spatial Development Accountability.
Workstream 1: Championing and Support
This workstream pertains to the custodianship of the NSDF and the 
process of ensuring that the NSDF is being advanced and institutionalised 
within government and across society.
A dedicated Spatial Transformation Unit in national government with the 
necessary resources and authority will be responsible for the following:
Embedding the NSDF in government and across society:
• Championing and guiding NSDF implementation;
• Undertaking broad-based communication of the NSDF to build 
shared understanding;
• Institutionalisation of the NSDF into Centre of Government Planning, 
Budgeting, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Systems;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 186
• Undertaking ongoing spatial development observation and 
research;
• Embedding collaborative planning and action ;
• Undertaking ongoing engagement spatial development norms, 
standards and differentiated guidelines for different integrated, 
inclusive and sustainable settlement formations;
• Providing technical support to departments, provinces, and 
municipalities in interpreting and applying the NSDF Frames and 
guidelines; and
• Reviewing and updating the NSDF.
Engaging in review of policy and fiscal tools and instruments that support 
and incentivize spatial transformation:
• Evaluating performance of fiscal instruments in relation to spatial 
transformation outcomes;
• Reviewing investment requirements, fiscal capacity, funding and 
financing strategies;
• Reviewing infrastructure and human settlement grant funding 
mechanisms;
• Undertaking socio-economic cost-benefit modelling; and
• Making recommendations with regard to the establishment of any 
special Spatial Funds.
Supporting coordination of spatial transformation and national priority 
actions:
• The NSDF will apply all at once across the country where the different 
role players have to exercise their mandates and perform their 
functions according to the spatial guidance and direction detailed 
in the NSDF Sub-Frames. There will have to be a focus on national 
priority issues and actions, i.e. the NSAAs, and these will be supported 
at a central coordinating level in a focused and phased manner;
• The Spatial Transformation Unit could sequence and support intensive 
focus and coordination of national sector strategies and plans in
each urban and rural region and corridor for defined periods until all 
regions are spatially transformed between now and 2050; and
• Similarly, in alignment with the NSDF and in coordination with the 
national spatial transformation unit, each Province will prepare or 
refine/adapt their PSDF and will undertake coordination at provincial 
level, to identify and sequence focal areas within the province.
Workstream 2: Development Planning Alignment
This workstream entails the process by which sector departments, 
provinces and municipalities prepare their sector strategies, spatial and 
development plans. These plans have to be reviewed and aligned with 
the NSDF.
Each national department, state entity, province and municipality 
already has a mandate and set of responsibilities in terms of planning, 
implementation and spatial governance. These roles will continue, but 
they will now have to be undertaken in adherence with the NSDF.
The priority for each role player will be:
• National sector departments have to prepare or review their sector 
strategies as long-term plans that respond/align to the broader 
development goals and objectives set out in the NDP and the 
spatial development objectives and outcomes set out in the NSDF;
• The key priority sector issues and strategies will have to focus on:
o Long-term water security for all, according to the desired 
future national spatial development pattern;National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 187
o Energy security for all according to the desired future national 
spatial development pattern;
o The provision of social services (schools, clinics, hospitals, 
community centres, sports fields, etc) to meet growth 
demands and according to the desired future spatial 
development pattern;
o Protection of high value agricultural land, surface water and 
biodiversity areas;
o Providing guidance as to where future settlement growth may 
take place, according to the desired future national spatial 
development pattern, and limiting the footprint of land 
development and human settlement in the process;
o Developing economic development strategy, highlighting 
the role, potential, opportunities and unique selling points 
across different places;
o The justification, spatial impacts and place-making logics of 
new economic nodes (SEZs, mines, industrial parks, 
commercial hubs) and economic infrastructure investment 
including roads, ports, rail, and telecommunications;
o Rehabilitation of mining land in declining mining areas and 
diversification of local economies;
o Guiding and resolving conflicting land uses according to the 
NSDF guidelines and by undertaking research and obtaining 
independent inputs and recommendations;
o Initiating well-considered rural development strategies and 
rural economic diversification and industrialization; and
o Working together with traditional leaders, preparing a 
framework for, and ensuring agreement on undertaking 
settlement planning and unlocking land development in 
areas under traditional authority control.
• Provinces have to:
o Prepare or review their PGDSs and PSDFs and align these with 
the NSDF;
o Coordinate the alignment of provincial sector and municipal 
plans and demonstrate how this alignment is contributing to 
the adherence of the NSDF; and
o Change provincial spending patterns according to desired 
spatial impact, especially human settlement subsidies.
• Similarly, municipalities have to:
o Prepare or review their IDPs and SDFs for their area of 
jurisdiction according to the spatial guidance and direction 
provided in the NSDF, and in alignment with the respective 
province; and
o Conduct spatial governance, undertake their spatial 
planning and land use management functions, more 
rigorously and in strict adherence with spatial transformation 
and inclusive place-making objectives as outlined in the 
NSDF.
• The private sector has to:
o Undertake investment and prepare development 
applications in accordance with the NSDF spatial guidance;
and
o Adhere to the SDF of the respective municipalities, and not 
undermine municipalities and/or act in any manner that 
compromises the shift to an efficient and inclusive spatial 
forms.
Workstream 3: Investment Spending Alignment
This workstream entails the process by which departments, state entities, 
provinces and municipalities undertake their budgeting and 
implementation processes. These processes have to be aligned to the 
NSDF.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 188
National Treasury (NT) will have to consider the alignment with the 
NSDF in the allocation and approval of budgets. A joint 
committee between the Spatial Transformation Unit and NT will 
consider infrastructure investment spending proposals and largescale projects will have to undergo spatial impact assessment 
prior to any approvals.
Workstream 4: National Spatial Development Accountability
A special spatial impact monitoring and reporting unit will be 
established to set up and operate a national spatial 
accountability system. This will entail coordinating the reporting 
by the various departments, state entities, provinces, 
municipalities and private sector in relation to adherence to the 
spatial guidance and direction set out in the NSDF and in relation 
to the performance of their own functions and performance 
against any specific/relevant actions identified in the NSDF.
Whereas in the past, role players were not sufficiently held to 
account for the spatial impact of their planning, investing and 
delivery processes, now each of the role players including private 
sector as part of the national spatial accountability system will be 
more rigorously engaged and will be obligated to report on how 
they are adhering/contributing or not through the performance 
of their own functions to the desired spatial development 
patterns and outcomes. 
The unit will establish criteria based on the NSDF Frames in 
assessing the planning and investment of role players and will 
prepare and submit reports on annual basis to cabinet to identify 
gaps and make proposals on improving alignment and 
adherence to the NSDF.
Workstream 1 will oversee and provide support for the alignment 
processes undertaken in workstreams 2 and 3. Workstream 4 will 
monitor the alignment and impacts of work undertaken in 
workstreams 2 and 3 (see Figure 66).National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 189
Figure 66: Workstream OverviewNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 190
6.4 Rolling out the NSDF
For the NSDF vision and goals to be achieved, along with the desired 
national spatial transformation, there are enabling activities, institutional 
mechanisms and capability enhancements that need to be considered 
for the national planning system to operate. As argued in a recent DPME 
report, “The imperative for institutionalisation is derived from identified 
gaps and the need to build the planning system by introducing a stronger 
and explicit developmental focus. In this context, institutionalisation 
means developing and strengthening the institutional, technical and 
administrative foundations (capacities, systems and processes) for a 
coordinated and responsive state that would be effective in promoting 
the structural changes required for inclusive growth, developing the 
country’s human resource base and a stronger democracy”.xx Capability 
enhancements to the spatial planning system include building spatial 
literacy within government and enhancing the coordination and 
alignment roles traditionally played by spatial planners in 
intergovernmental systems. 
Given that the capability of the state is a key enabler of effective 
planning,governance and implementation, the implementation of the 
NSDF (1) is intrinsically tied to government’s institutional, organisational 
and individual capabilities, and (2) rests on two interrelated components:
• The use and application of the NSDF to guide action and spatial 
investment; and
• The building of ‘national spatial planning and transformation capability’
to undertake, manage and develop the benefits of spatial planning 
at an institutional, organisational and individual level within 
government and more broadly, across society.
The promulgation of SPLUMA has clarified the role of spatial planning and 
land-use management. At the same time, the systems and frameworks 
for intergovernmental planning and budgeting are being institutionalised 
and improved. Implementation, like planning, is, however, not a once-off 
step. In the case of the NSDF, it is also a continuous process of mobilising
resources and action, guided by the objectives and desired outcomes of 
the NDP. Improvements and refinements are also made through 
monitoring and review, to (1) improve approaches and understandings, 
and (2) overcome obstacles on a continuousbasis. 
The NSDF has identified five areas for action that need to be considered. 
These consist of three enabling components and two change and
transformation-driving components.
The three enabling components are:
• A championing capability, with associated programmes for 
building spatial transformation capability and supporting 
behaviour change;
• Supporting the ‘centre of government’ institutions in improving 
developmental outcomes through the system of planning, 
budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; and
• Guiding the alignment and coordination of investment spending 
and planning capacity development, both (1) within 
government spheres and sectors, and (2) through broader 
private sector, civil society and learning organisation support and 
involvement.
The two change and transformation-driving components are:
• Communicating and sharing the NSDF, to ensure that it is broadly 
understood, and its use is enabled; andNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 191
• Specific and priority spatially targeted initiatives that (1) are of 
national significance, and (2) draw from the core components of the
NSDF, as set out in Part Five
The five action areas would, taken as a whole, enable the NSDF and 
national spatial planning to be:
• Championed: National spatial planning is championed, researched
andcontinually refinedanddeveloped,andnational spatial planning 
capability and support systems are built across society, to ensure the 
desired national spatial development patterns and outcomes;
• Communicated: The NSDF is broadly shared to ensure awareness and 
buy-in across society;
• Institutionalised in centre of government systems: National spatial 
planning (1) supports and responds to the developmental agenda of 
the state, as articulated in the NDP, and (2) is articulated through key 
national planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation systems;
• Embedded: The NSDF is well-understood and actors can (1) respond
to it, and (2) utilize it to guide and coordinate investment to transform 
space through provincial, regional and municipal SDFs and sector
plans; and
• Actioned: Strategic spatial initiatives and priorities within the NSDF are 
acted upon and implemented (1) in a systemic way, and (2) by 
appropriate champions and role-players who have a direct 
mandate relating to each priority.
Each of these aspects is discussed in more detail below:
6.4.1 Objective One: Championing and Guiding NSDF 
Implementation
A key capability is a national institutional home for spatial planning and 
spatial transformation. As a matter of urgency there is a need to resolve
the issue of ‘the home of spatial planning nationally’. Consideration should 
also be given to establishing a dedicated ‘unit’, staffed with the necessary 
technical and administrative expertise. The aim of this Unit would be to:
• Provide advice and guidance on how to maximise spatial impacts 
and transformation across government;
• Actively coordinate across government for better spatial outcomes;
• Report on implementation of the NSDF, and the extent to which 
outcomes are achieved; and
• Build spatial literacy within government and strengthen the capacity 
and capability of planners and the spatial planning system.
Three functions would be important, amongst others. First, to work across 
government to align spatial action to the NSDF and support spatial 
transformation more broadly. This would be both at the strategic levels of
the MTSP/MTSF and MTEF and other associated centre of government 
coordinating mechanisms and through national sector, provincial and 
local planning. Second, to champion research into, and around spatial 
planning and improving its utility to government. This could include 
working with learning organisations, civil society and other bodies to
improve spatial planning capability. Third, to, through a consultative
process, develop a framework for monitoring and evaluating the 
efficacy and realisation of spatial transformation, and in particular
focusing on the priority actions associated with the NSDF frames.
To facilitate this role, it is proposed that consideration be given to 
establishing two supporting structures. Firstly, a ‘National Spatial National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 192
Transformation Working Group’ chaired by a/the lead spatial planning 
department. The aim of this working group would be to coordinate 
national action around spatial transformation. Second, a ‘National 
Spatial Transformation Committee’. This advisory and support committee 
should comprise representatives of the three spheres of government, the 
private sector, academia and professional bodies. Although drawing on 
the NSDF, this committee would havea broader focus and be composed 
with the aim of informing the spatial transformation agenda of 
government and society. Given the important role of evidence, 
monitoring and knowledge-sharing, this capacity needs to be enabled. 
As such, it could also guide the building and deepening of ‘spatial 
literacy’ and spatial planning capabilities amongst the built environment 
professions and within government.
The detailed terms of reference for the proposed Unit, Working Group 
and Committee would have to be developed while taking cognisance 
of existing structures and current processes, to avoid duplication and to
ensure alignment, e.g. with the IUDF Working Group.
A priority for the proposed Unit, should be to engage in discussions with 
National Treasury on the development of a fund under the jurisdiction of 
the Unit to support transformation objectives. The scope of the fund 
would need to be developed in consultation, but aspects could include 
those relating to supporting spatial transformation initiatives of national 
significance (especially around coordination and alignment in space 
and time), spatial planning and transformation
Figure 67: Championing of Spatial Transformation
6.4.2 Objective Two: Communication of Shared Action
Communication is an essential and often neglected aspect of 
implementation. It is also a cost-effective way of building understanding
and shared action. People and institutions can only act on, and invest in, 
a plan they know and understand. An effective communication strategy

that targets all spheres of government, the private sector, academia and 
civil society will have to be put into place. The proposed Spatial 
Transformation Unit should be tasked with developing and implementing
this, and the requisite funding provided.
This communications strategy would need to work across a range of
platforms. Considerationshould be given to professional communications 
support, to develop and, as and where necessary, implement certain 
components of the communications strategy. Two key components 
should be included in such a strategy:
• A strong web-presence and profiling on key government websites, 
and in particular, ‘centre of government departments’xxi, which 
includes The Presidency, DPME,CoGTA, DRDLR, and NT; and
• The use of existing inter-governmental engagement platforms to 
profile and explain the NSDF, including key government partners, 
such as SALGA, who would be a crucial ally in introducing and 
communicating the NSDF to municipalities.
6.4.3 Objective Three: Institutionalisation of the NSDF into 
Centre of Government Planning, Budgeting, 
Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation System
Consideration needstobegivenas to how the NSDF will link to the broader 
systems of planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation in government. Thisincludes discussion as to how the NSDF 
could, amongst others:
• Support and strengthen the proposed Medium-Term Strategic Plan 
(MTSP) and the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF);
• Inform and help strengthen the ‘Budget Mandate Paper’;
• Improve alignment of sector and sphere budgeting, especially as 
related to spatially-targeted capital spending (and long-term 
infrastructure spending in particular);
• Contribute, through its implementation processes, to capacity 
building that impacts and supports spatial transformation;and
• Assist in identifying where special grants or other funding mechanisms 
could be considered to support spatial targeting, regional planning 
and other programmes aimed at spatial transformation
Figure 68: Clear Line of SightNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 194
Suggestions for discussion include:
DPME
• DPME utilizes the NSDF to provide the spatial lens to the MediumTerm Strategic Plan (MTSP).
• In line with the above, the DPME utilizes the NSDF as the spatial 
representation of the Mandate Paper (annually) prioritization and 
the MTSF (five-year cycle).
• That DPME monitors the alignment of sector budget spending in
physical space in line with the NSDF.
National Treasury
• In recognising the role of the NSDF in coordinating spending in 
space, NT could consider ways to use it to guide national sector 
department budgets (especially long- term infrastructure) and 
check that programmes align to and reinforce the objectives of 
the NSDF.
• That this spending and prioritization is monitored and reported on.
COGTA
• That CoGTA supports the developmental, place-based and 
regional approach of the NSDF through capability- building and 
other related initiatives. This approach could take the form of 
regional intervention starting with PGDSs and PSDFs (and possibly 
associated RSDFs).
DRDLR
• That DRDLR (or the department responsible for spatial planning) 
establish a well-resourced and capacitated Spatial Planning 
Support Agency (or similar) that sees to, and if necessary, funds the 
placement of accredited spatial planners in every municipality.
• That DRDLR (or the department responsible for spatial planning) 
considers how to empower planners and support them in building 
and enabling cross-sphere alignment with spatial planning.
Figure 69 below illustrates conceptually the interface of the NSDF with the 
national system of planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring 
as discussed above and in the following section. Milestones of the 
implementation and monitoring system are as follows:National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 195
Figure 69: National Role in System of Planning, Budgeting, Implementation and Monitoring National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 196
1.) Five-year national planning cycle: After a national election a five-year 
plan of action is developed. Given the status of the NDP, this draws from 
the NDP, a shared plan. This plan is used to inform the MTSF of government 
as a whole. The NSDF is aligned to the NDP and is likewise reviewed every 
five years. It must also find expression in the MTSP. Annually the Mandate 
Paper identifies key priorities, likewise, there should be spatial investment 
priorities identified drawing on the MTSP.
2.) Three-to-five-year actions: Taking their cue from the MTSF and NDP, 
sector departments and municipalities formulate their strategic plans 
(three-five years) and National Treasury developments the budget and 
MTEF to the same logic. National sector departments and municipalities
must then utilise the NSDF to develop their own spatial depiction of their 
strategic plans and link these to their budgets (the spatial investment
components).
3.) Annual actions: Annual performance plans and budgets then need 
to set targets for each against the long-term strategic plan.
6.4.4 Objective Four: Embedding Implementation and 
Collaborative Action
All government departments preparing sector plans need to consider 
their spatial impact, especially as related to capital and infrastructure 
spending, and such plans must be aligned with the spatial priorities 
outlined in the NSDF. The aim is to achieve crucial urban, rural, municipal, 
provincial, regional and national development goals and objectives. This 
discussion needs to be focused on the procedures to facilitate and 
promote cooperative government and intergovernmental relations in 
respect of spatial development planning.
This aspect needs to explore the way in which this is done through:
• National sector departments;
• Provincial government plans;
• Municipal planning;
• Sub-national or regional planning;
• The private sector;
• Civil society; and
• Learning organisations.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 197
Suggestions for discussion include:
National and 
Provincial 
Sector 
Departments
It is suggested that national sector departments and 
their provincial counterparts add a spatial component 
to their strategic plans that (1) is aligned to the NSDF,
and (2) depicts the location of their spending, 
especially those components with a specific spatial 
and/or capital/infrastructure expenditure component. 
In doing so, they should also indicate how they will 
engage with the unique attributes of the places where 
the investment will ‘land’ in a sub-national space in 
such manner that it (1) responds to the unique regional 
and local challenges (as articulated in the IDP and 
SDFs), and (2) supports regional and local 
development in the area concerned.
When new national policy or legislation is 
contemplated, a Socio-Economic Impact Assessment 
System (SEAIS) is required. The suggestion is that an 
indicative capital expenditure spatial framework be 
incorporated as part of the Socio-Economic Impact 
Assessment System (SEAIS).
Provincial 
Government
That Provincial Governments explore practical ways of 
utilizing the NSDF as an important contextual frame for 
the preparation of their PGDSs and PSDFs.
Regional 
Development 
Collaborators
Local 
Government
The NSDF could identify, make use of and coordinate 
relevant regional collaboration, and/or spatial 
development planning initiatives. Recent examples 
are the Nama Karoo and the Northern Free-State 
Regional Initiatives, and associated RSDF processes. 
That consideration be given by municipalities to 
practically using the NSDF as a ‘crucial frame’ in the 
preparation and review of their IDPs and SDFs, and any 
other form of long-term strategic planning.
Citizens and 
Civil Society 
Organisations 
& the Private 
Sector
That citizens, civil society organisations and the private 
sector are encouraged to engage proactively and on 
a continuous base with the NSDF, to ensure that their 
investment and spending decisions (1) respond to, 
and support national, regional and local needs, and 
(2) actively contribute to national spatial 
transformation and inclusive economic growth.
Learning 
Institutions
and the 
Capacity building on national (1) trends, dynamics, 
challenges and opportunities, (2) sense-making, and 
(3) spatial development concepts and plans is 
important. Learning institutions are encouraged to National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 198
Planning 
Profession
Research 
Institutions 
and 
Initiatives
follow, analyse and constructively critique the 
implementation of the NSDF with a view to offering 
reflections and insights on how it might be improved 
and/or refined when it is next reviewed. 
Ongoing research on national spatial development 
and inter-regional dynamics and spatial development 
scenarios is imperative. These entities are ideally 
placed to initiate and undertake and sustain such 
research.
6.4.5 Objective Five: Sector Specific and Spatially Targeted 
Priorities Actioned
This objective is the most important for spatial transformation. All the 
preceding objectives ultimately need to focus on the sector specific and 
spatially-targeted priorities identified in the NSDF’s Frame and SubFrames.
The NSDF seeks to support improved investment impact and alignment
of (1) national integrated and sector plans, and (2) provincial and 
regional plans and strategies within the context of government’s fiveyear planning and review cycle and process. As indicated in Figure 70
below, this it does by (1) being informed, and taking its cue from the NDP 
and a myriad of other multi-term, multi-sector, multi-sphere spatialdecision-making processes and plans, frameworks, strategies and 
programmes, and in turn (2) guiding many of these, and a range of other 
such plans, frameworks, strategies and programmes when they are being 
prepared, implemented and/or reviewed.
Figure 70: The Envisaged Role of the NSDF in Plan Preparation, Budgeting, 
Implementation and Review Cycles in Government
The envisaged role of the National Spatial Development Frame and SubFrames in the spatial alignment of Government’s planning instruments 
and cycles is set out in Figure 71.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 199

Figure 72: Priority National Spatial Action AreasNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 201
6.5 Implementation Planning
The NSDF has two key target dates:
• 2030: In alignment with the NDP; and
• 2050: In recognition of (1) the long-term infrastructural, and (2) other 
investments required over time to completely transform our society 
and country from colonialism and Apartheid to a truly democratic 
Post-Apartheid society.
Implementation of the NSDF has three ‘cycles’:
Cycle 1: Initiation 2019 to 2023
• Within this cycle the focus is on alignment of long-term plans, vision 
and shared understanding.
• This is achieved through building the championing capability and 
ensuring broad communication and awareness.
• The key targets for this phase include:
o Establishment of a championing capability that is well resourced 
and enabled (measured by establishment of institutional 
capacity with this mandate);
o Raising awareness of the NSDF and its implications across all three 
spheres of government, learning organisations, civil society and 
private sector (measured by acknowledgement in the MTSP/MTSF 
and MTEF and use of and reference to the NSDF vision in 
alignment of national sector plans, PGDSs and municipal 
SDFs/IDPs); and
o Responding to the call for action regarding the NSAAs in Part 5, 
and planning for and embarking on decisive action in 
accordance with the guidance provided.
Cycle 2: Alignment, budgeting and execution 2024 to 2043
• Here the focus is on alignment of spatial strategy and medium-term 
plans.
• Strengthening and deepening of action in accordance with the 
provisions of the NSAAs is now well under way, and in some cases, 
notably the NSAAs relating to the environment, the objectives with 
regards to stabilisation, preservation, protection and management of 
fragile ecosystems have been realised. 
• This cycle is broken up into four five-year cycles corresponding with 
the five-year government planning cycles. In this phase the aim is to 
build on the foundation laid in the initiation phase.
• In the first five-year cycle (2024 to 2028), the main focus would be on 
Institutionalisation of the NSDF and embedding the NSDF in national, 
provincial and municipal planning. The key targets in this phase 
include:
o Use of the NSDF in the MTSP/MTSF and MTEF, and other centre of 
government planning, budgeting and implementation tools 
(measured by the use of the NSDF in guiding priority actions at a 
national level to align and guide spatially targeted investment); 
and
o Use of the NSDF in the Sector Plans, PGDSs and SDFs/IDP to enable 
greater cross-country coherence, whilst still respecting provincial 
and local contexts and challenges (measured by use of and 
reference to the NSDF).
• In the next three five-year cycles, the aim is to see a refinement and 
deepening of the institutionalisation and embedding, but with 
greater emphasis being placed on the execution of the spatial 
priorities identified in the NSDF Spatial Frames (measured by project 
progress on priorities and budget allocations).National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 202
Cycle 3: Renew and re-do 2044 to 2049
• In the last five-year cycle, it would be expected of implementation to 
continue, but for a full evaluation to be undertaken and the 
preparation for the compilation of the next NSDF to begin.
The Implementation Cycles are shown in Figure 73 below, and the shifting 
focus of NSDF implementation over time is shown in Figure 74 on the 
following page.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 203

6.6 NSDF Review
As indicated in Section 
6.2, the NSDF takes a long
-term view with both a 
2030
-horizon and a 2050
-horizon. However, reality dictates that there will 
many changes and impacts over the course of this period which cannot 
be foreseen. The five
-yearly reviews, in accordance with SPLUMA, are 
sure to result in shifts in the Frame, Sub
-Frames, desired National Spatial 
Outcomes and Priority Actions. It is, however, expected that the key 
transformative elements of the Vision and Logic will hold true, and 
continue to guide action
6.7 Monitoring and Evaluation
The regular process of five
-yearly review, along with a mid
-term review of 
the NSDF and its impacts, will require a monitoring and evaluation 
framework to be developed. Some indication has already been given as 
to the broad indicators and measurement of the NSDF. However, this 
monitoring and review framework needs to specifically address the 
achievement of the NSDF transformational changes and impacts. This will 
need to be an important focus of the championing agent in the initiation 
phase. The development of the framework is also an opportunity to 
contribute to deepening the understanding of the NSDF and its intended 
outcomes. It should thus be used as an opportunity to (1) engage the 
three spheres of government and other civil society, learning and private 
sector bodies, and (2) continue the discussions started in and through the 
compilation of the NSDF.
This broad overall monitoring will work in tandem with the national spatial 
accountability system under Workstream 4.National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 207
PART SEVEN: ConclusionNational Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 208
This Draft NSDF highlighted the persistence of colonial and apartheid 
spatial patterns and their detrimental impact on the ability of 
government to meet its national development objectives of reducing 
poverty, inequality and unemployment. To rid the country of this stubborn 
historical spatial stranglehold, a theory of change was developed that 
relies on, and proposes radical and decisive intervention in the national:
• Spatial development logic and pattern;
• Natural resource use and maintenance profile; and
• Patterns of ownership of, and access to, land and other 
resources.
The desired national spatial development vision, logic, and pattern, as 
put forward in the NSDF hold out the real promise of a very different South 
Africa by 2050. While providing overarching national spatial direction, 
catalytic impetus and guidance in moving the country towards the 2050-
vision, the realisation of this desired South Africa will require of the NSDF 
to be:
• Championed;
• Communicated;
• Institutionalised;
• Embedded; and
• Actioned.
These five actions demand equally radical and decisive change in the 
way investment and spending is planned, budgeted for and done in the 
national space. While these changes will not always be easy, and entail 
very different ways of engaging, collaborating and acting, the rewards 
of doing so will far outweigh the sacrifices – a peaceful, prosperous and 
truly transformed South Africa by 2050!National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 209

Supportive Information on Spatial Information
and Models
This Annexure is not exhaustive and only provides limited information in
support of the Draft NSDF 2019. Over the past number of years, the CSIR, together with other role players,
has invested in building capability to provide spatial planning, analysis,
modelling and platform support to government, with a focus on
strengthening strategic regional, inter-regional and intergovernmental
planning, resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation in South
Africa. A key focus was the ability to enable a ‘whole of country’ spatial
relational analysis and comparison of key settlement and population
data and indicators.
Regional Spatial Data Frame used for
Indicators and Settlement Pattern Analysis
 http://stepsa.org/socio_econ.html for more detail and to
download data
MESOFRAME
The Mesozone data set is referenced several times in the NSDF and was
used for the fine grained spatial analysis of a large number of variables
and indicators. For more information and to download data, please see
http://stepsa.org/socio_econ.html
The ‘Mesoframe’ is a demarcation of South Africa into a complete grid
of approximately 25 000 spatial units. These mesozones are not uniform in
shape but aim to be approximately the same size (~50km2) for improved
comparison of different spaces and more accurate visual representation
and interpretation of data. The mesozones were created in such a way
that they (1) fit within the current municipalities, and (2) are largely
homogeneous with respect to other significant geo-economic, topographic and historic political area demarcations. The zone
boundaries correspond with major travel barriers (such as rivers) as well
as areas demarcated as uninhabited/ sparsely populated
(Mountainous/ wilderness areas) and areas with medium to high levels of
human activity (such as fertile valleys or built up areas).
The population and socio-economic datasets are assigned to
mesozones based on an algorithm developed by the CSIR, which is
based on the principles of dasymetric mapping. This approach is also
used to calculate population distribution at a fine scale. The StatsSA 1996
(Enumerator Areas - EAs), 2001 (Sub Places - SPs), 2011 (SPs) and 2016
(SPs) population figures are used as the input-data for the respective2
years. These data sets have different spatial demarcations and the data
has thus been re-aligned to the mesozones to create a comparable time
series data set using secondary data. The Spot Building Count (SBC), for
which ESKOM is the data-custodian, is used as the secondary dataset to
assign/ predict the underlying statistical surface of the origin data.
The GVA data for the different economic sectors are produced at local
municipal level by Quantec. The municipal level GVA data has been re- assigned to the mesozones using the same principles of dasymetric
mapping. Secondary data is used to represent the potential points where
production is occurring to re-assign the economic production data to the
mesozones. The total employment index per mesozone is derived from
the GVA index by firstly calculating the ratio of GVA production per
sector to the employment per sector for each local municipality. The
employment and GVA data for the different economic sector factor is
then multiplied with the economic production values per mesozone.
TOWN TYPOLOGY (2010-2018)
In 2015, the updated CSIR/SACN functional settlement typology that
provided a mechanism to identify, calculate and analyse a set of
development information and trends pertaining to the range of towns
and cities, as well as high density rural settlements across South Africa was
published. This typology enables an understanding and analyses of the
network of settlements, towns and cities and the hierarchical and
functional relationships between them, especially related to government
and economic service provision and migration. Given the fact that
spatially comparable administrative information covers wall-to-wall
municipal jurisdiction areas, the functional town area demarcation and
town profiling was used extensively as basis to describe and compare
cities and towns across South Africa, as well as town growth trends in
support of government policy. This inter alia includes the use of (1) the
2010-version of the typology in Chapter 8 in the NDP, 2012; and (2) the
updated version in the IUDF, 2015, the SACN SOCR, 2016 and the DRDLR
Social Facility Toolkit, 2016.
In February 2018, the CSIR made available a further update and rework
of the settlement typology that included:  Updated socio-economic indicators based on the CSIR Meso- Frame up to 2016; and
 A derived understanding of potential roles of towns within their
regional contexts, including an analyses of national and regional
gateways and anchors conducted for the Economic
Development Department in 2014. A finer-grained identification and description of small towns and growing
rural settlements, considering their service role within local hinterlands
and not merely based on the population size but also the economy. This
was further informed by the, CSIR Social Facility Settlement Prioritisation,
2016; DRDLR Social Facility Toolkit, 2016 and the SALGA Small Town
Regeneration Programme, 2017-2018. The typology was also updated to include the identification of new and
expanding settlement areas by using the unique CSIR Settlement
Footprint created in support of the CSIR Green Book, 2019. In this process,
the built up area of each settlement was demarcated using a
combination of satellite imagery, housing point data and fine grained
StatsSA population data sets. This enabled clear demarcation of built-up
areas that in turn enabled more accurate calculation of population
numbers and profiling of individual settlements and analysis of changing
settlement dynamics and trends.3
As such, the typology enables calculation of the population and the
economy of functional town areas (as opposed to municipal area
statistics) and a comparison of town areas relative to non–town areas as
well as the ability to explore regional and spatial inter-relations of
settlements as well as the trends within specific types of settlements. The
Typology also enables regional-scale, temporal and spatial comparison
of settlements regardless of administrative boundaries. For access to the
spatial frame, and socio-economic indicators, please see ‘Indicator’ where the data can also be downloaded. Bibliography:

Population Projections and Spatial Settlement
Growth Modelling and Allocation
Population projections and location specific scenario modelling for South
Africa was undertaken by the CSIR as part of the Green Book (2019)
process. This was made available for use in the NSDF process and was
used to explore the most likely spatial implication of population growth
projections for both low and high in-migration scenarios. This growth
scenario is a first of its kind to explore the implication of population growth
taking into consideration migration patterns, as well as spatial-locational
attraction and distribution of growth.
In compiling the NSDF, use was also made of the following Green Book
(2018) population modelling outputs:
 National population growth projections at country level within
South African-specific context and scientifically verified up to
2050 for two growth scenarios. A medium and a high growth
scenario were generated by the Green Book 2019 – both verified
by expert reference groups. After consideration of the scenarios
and benchmarking against other projections, the NSDF made use
of the medium population growth scenario with respect to
planning and implementation.  Downscaled medium population growth scenarios developed at
provincial and district scales to understand the most probable
regional growth pressures for 2030 and 2050.  A novel and innovative settlement growth model to derive
settlement level population projections. This model has been
developed to utilise provincial and district scale population
growth projections to derive and model growth of individual
settlements. The model utilises a gravity model, based on
“population potential” during the population growth allocation
process. The latter is a measure of the “attractive force” of a
particular grid cell for further population growth considers
relational spatial impacts in the model. The expectation of
different rates of change for the different settlement types was
accounted for in the model-making that was done in analysing
the spatial attraction of existing agglomeration economies and
concentrations based on the CSIR Functional Town Typology,
2018 and CSIR Open Settlement Footprint, 2017*.  The results of the Population Projections and CSIR Town Growth
Model were used in the NSDF 2018 as a “Without Intervention
National Settlement Scenario” of most likely growth pressures for
settlements in South Africa.  The “Without Intervention National Settlement Scenario”
including national growth projections of model results were then
used with the NSDF Vision and implementation frames and the4
expected impacts of growth and available resources, as
highlighted in Part 3 of the Draft NSDF, to construct an alternative
envisaged settlement-allocation pattern of the “NSDF
Implementation Settlement Scenario” that is based on a
sustainable national settlement growth outcome through
successful implementation of the NSDF Vision. This alternative
NSDF Settlement Allocation Scenario is “a Vision of a preferred
outcome of future spatial patterns given the available
information”, and was informed by (1) significant national
development objectives, (2) the national spatial development
vision, (3) the national spatial development concepts, (4)
resources and outcomes as attractors, and (5) global and
national risks as push factors.
The CSIR Green Book modelling approach, inputs and high level outputs
available are set out in Figure A1 and national level results in Figure A2. The population projections of Prof L. van Tonder, the lead expert for the
CSIR, Green Book population projection work, 2018 have been proven to
be consistently accurate over time when compared to World Bank and
United Nations Projections. The modelled national population projections
for two scenarios, as developed from the model, are indicated in Figure
2. High and medium scenarios refer to differences in international in- migration scenarios. National population projections clearly illustrate the
need to plan for at least a 30% increase in population by 2050, with the
medium scenario indicating a population of 75 million by 2050, and the
higher in-migration scenario, a population of 80 million by 2050. This can
have significant spatial implications, with the population projected to
grow primarily in the urban core and secondary cities and large towns.
#The Settlement Footprint defines the spatial extent of the actual built up areas
of each settlement and differentiates this area from the surrounding rural
hinterland. This layer aims to provide a more accurate GIS based extent of the
built up footprints of SA settlements. The Settlement footprint was recently
developed for South Africa, and was defined based on a spatial extent of the
settlement footprint created by using a combination of StatsSA small areas and
main places, the ESKOM spot building count (adapted and corrected) and
land cover related information. Demographic information for the respective
settlements has been compiled using the outlined data through a spatial
disaggregation process. The population baseline data made use of StatsSA,
2011 demographic data. For more information see (Maritz et al, 2018 – In
process) Settlement footprint layer 2017, CSIR 2017. Bibliography:  Green Book. 2019. Green Book: Adapting South African settlements to

Using national level growth projections, provincial and district level allocations were modelled and results can be seen in Figure A 3 and A4. These
were in turn used as inputs for the location-specific modelled results at settlement level using a gravity based model. In addition to demographic
trends the gravity model developed by the CSIR currently enables consideration of:  Past settlement growth patterns,  An economic attraction pull factor depending on the role of a settlement/town or city (using the CSIR, Town Area Typology, 2018 town
demarcations and profiles); and
 Location-specific exclusion areas.7
The projections were downscaled and the methodology tested against a simulation of 2001-2011 population data that provided very high levels of
accuracy-98% for district level and 95% for settlement level. Please see the diagrams below for examples of downscaled district and settlement
allocations as used for the “NSDF 2018 Without Intervention National Settlement Scenario” (Medium Population Growth Projections and CSIR Green

Climate Change Projections
Climate change is a term that generally refers to a shift in weather
phenomena associated with an increase in global average
temperatures that would have occurred normally over long time
periods. Human intervention, however, is rapidly affecting the average
surface temperatures, which in turn are resulting in changes to climate
patterns. In compiling the Draft NSDF, use was made of climate
change projection data from the CSIR Green Book project.
Overview of methodology used for Climate Modelling
Down Scale Climate Modelling at 8 km resolution was conducted by
Prof Francois Engelbrecht, CSIR. The 8 km resolution projections were
obtained by further downscaling of the CSIR’s existing set of 50 km
resolution CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment)
projections of future climate change. These CORDEX projections are
for two emission level mitigation scenarios, namely Regional
Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5; low mitigation) and RCP4.5 (high
mitigation). For each of these emission pathways, six global circulation
models (GCMs) that contributed to Assessment Report Five (AR5) of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were
downscaled to 50 km resolution over the globe, as part of the CSIR’s
contribution to CORDEX.
In the Green Book project, all these simulations (twelve ensemble
members in total) were downscaled further to 8 km-resolution over
South Africa. The projections were analysed statistically in the Green
Book of South Africa Climate Change Projection report and the
1
implications for South Africa discussed. The uncertainty range
described by these projections is still to be described within the context
of the much larger, but lower resolution ensemble of AR5 GCM
projections.
Results and Implications
In order to sufficiently identify the spatial implications of climate
change for South Africa, several fine scaled climate change
projections were recently undertaken as part of a project entitled:
“Settlement design guidelines for climate change adaptation in South
Africa” (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, 2016)1. The
resulting projections generally predict severe temperature increases
for Southern Africa. It is especially the northern and the western parts
of South Africa that can expect significantly hotter average
temperatures and more very hot days per year by 2050. By the end of
the century, temperature increases of between 4 and 7°C can be
expected over the interior of the country.
Furthermore, generally drier conditions and the more frequent
occurrence of dry spells are plausible over parts of the interior as
indicated in Figure 7. Areas most affected by decreases in rainfall are
the Western Cape (winter rainfall region), parts of the Northern Cape,
central part of the Eastern Cape and areas in Mpumalanga along the
eastern escarpment as well as parts of the Limpopo Province.
Increase in annual-average near-surface temperatures are projected
to occur over large parts of South Africa, including the western interior
and northern parts of South Africa. This is critical as the central and
northern parts of the interior are important agriculture production10
areas currently. Aligned with the increase in temperatures is the likely
increase in high fire-danger days, heat-wave days and very hot days
and drier conditions referred to above.
For the period 2021-2050, relative to the period 1971-2000, (under low
mitigation), rainfall is projected to increase over the central interior and
east coast. This is most likely to go hand in hand with extreme rainfall
events which have significant implications for infrastructure, flooding
and water availability. Severe climate events are likely to endanger
lives and cause damage to the built environment, which would have
knock-on effects on economic development and negatively impact
service delivery and sustainable development in the areas of greatest
need. The negative impacts are not likely to be limited to the
agricultural sector. The shift in rainfall patterns, together with rising
temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide is likely to enhance
vegetation growth in some regions, which could result in bush
encroachment in Savannah regions – the Kruger National Park is one
area at risk. This could change ecosystem and population dynamics,
leading to a change in plant and animal communities (Griffin, 2012). Climate change does pose a significant threat to South Africa’s
current water resources, food security, health, established
infrastructure, as well as its ecosystem services and biodiversity.
Considering South Africa’s high levels of poverty and inequality, these
impacts also pose critical challenges for national development
(Ziervogel, et al., 2014). Climate change also has serious long-term implications for human
habitation and the productivity of agriculture. These projections
suggest an increasingly important role for the central and south- eastern part parts of the country for (1) human settlement and (2) food
production. To accommodate both, a concerted ‘national spatial
compaction, shrinking, and sharing-drive’ will be required. Changing
climate could also benefit areas allowing different crops to be
cultivated in areas not previously possible. See consolidated summary
map based on the projections done through the CSIR Green Book
(2019) below.

(Sub-Frame 2)
B3.1 Significant Urban Regions and Cities
The NSDF spatial frame identifies the urban-regions and cities that are
foreseen to play a critical role in (1) housing the South African
population and (2) in the national economy and that require focussed
intervention (see Table A1). The three national Urban Regions (identified based on existing densities
and size, current and projected future population growth (2050), the
size and diversity of the economy and social and economic reach and
inter-regional role), are:  The Gauteng Urban Region (and surrounding cities in the urbaninnovation belt);  Cape Town Urban Region (extending towards surrounding urban
clusters); and
 The eThekwini Urban Region (extending to functionally linked areas
within iLembe, Ugu, uMgungundlovu Districts and Msunduzi City).
National Urban Nodes include existing and emerging cities identified
to play a significant role in national and regional development, are:  Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan region;  Mangaung City Area;  Mbombela City Area;  Rustenburg City Area;  Buffalo City Area;  Polokwane City Area;  Richards Bay Large Regional Centre; and
 Msunduzi City Area.
These urban regions and big cities, as priority national nodes on the
urban network, and places within identified growth and transformation
corridors, would need to play a critical role for consolidated urban
livelihoods and facilitating a more sustainable and just national spatial
settlement pattern as set out by the NSDF. Selection criteria included the following considerations (for studies and
references see B3.4):  Firstly, the spatial extent and densities: High density settlement
footprint, as well as surrounding functional region that include a
network of linked polycentric urban nodes and surrounding
‘satellite’ towns, former spatially segregated township areas,
dense rural settlements and urban social and economic services,
characterised by intense socio-economic and daily commuting
interaction. The CSIR Settlement Typology 2018 was used as basis
for demarcation and calculation. The Town Area Typology is based
on a spatial data and indicator framework designed to identify,
track and compare regional and inter-regional spatial and
settlement patterns and trends. The town area extent is based on
the ‘GAP Meso Frame’ (2018 Update), an extensive series of spatial
data indicators derived from StatsSA and verified to enable spatial
trend analyses, and verified with the fine grained CSIR Settlement
Footprint Layer, 2018 (based on SPOT Building Count, StatsSA
Enumerator Areas and disaggregated socio-economic trend data
up to 2011).  Secondly, Indicators of size and growth: Population size and growth
trends, as well as migration attraction indicators;  Thirdly, indicators of economic size and growth, including total
economic output, employment, economic sector specific size and
growth trends;  Fourthly, inter-regional and national gate-way functions and
services provided, including: administrative functions, ports and
trade and logistics, and indexes of economic diversity and regional
economic functional-clustering in terms of international head
offices, the financial sector and international tourism.14

Priority regional development anchors were identified from a wide
range of existing and emerging towns, identified as towns that are,
and could, fulfil a regional function within productive rural regions in
support of national and regional development objectives.
The CSIR Town Typology was utilised as basis (See Table A2), to enable
identification of regional settlement nodes. Selection criteria included
the following considerations (for studies and references see B3.4):  Firstly, the location and spatial extent and densities include
areas (towns) of dense settlement footprints and surrounding
functional settlement areas that include former spatially
segregated township areas, and dense rural settlements. As
outlined in Annexure A, the Town Area Typology is based on (1)
a spatial data and indicator framework designed to identify,
track and compare regional and inter-regional spatial and
settlement patterns and trends (‘GAP Meso Frame’ (2018
Update) and (2) an extensive series of spatial data indicators
derived from StatsSA, which was verified to enable spatial
trend analyses. The spatial extent of towns was verified with the
fine-grained CSIR Settlement Footprint Layer, 2018 (based on
SPOT Building Count, StatsSA Enumerator Areas and
disaggregated socio-economic trend data up to 2011).  Secondly, indicators of population and economic size and
growth: Population and economic size and growth trends, as
well as migration attraction indicators; and
 Thirdly, the identification of local and regional size and service
reach (including economic, administrative but also social
service facility access) of towns within their unique
typographies and diverse development contexts. This enabled
identification of towns that might be smaller in size but do play
a significant role in remote regions, or of growing nodes in
dense rural settlement regions with limited access to larger
cities and towns.
Identification of the NSDF national network of regional development
anchors included consideration of expected and projected regional15
trends and desired national spatial pattern. Given current spatial
patterns a specific focus was placed on identification of emerging
nodes to support national urbanisation (become the cities of the
future) in the central, eastern and coastal transformation and
development corridors.
Regional and rural typography, road distance and access analysis
under conditions of improved rural connectivity and distance analyses
assisted in identifying growth centres that can play the role of
strategically located regional and rural development anchors as part
of the Regional-Rural Development Model and act as spatial levers. Provincial plans and strategic focus areas, as well as existing national
investments such as Industrial Development Zones, Spatial Economic
Development Zones, Agri-Hubs and Aqua focus areas were also taken
into consideration in the identification process. Regional development
anchor-selection was also informed by the network of towns that play
strategic regional roles as identified on the basis of nationally
comparative town profiles developed as part of the CSIR, 2018 Town
Area Typology. The location of regional development anchors took
into consideration key national transport routes and the relationship to
the networks of Regional Service Centres and Service Towns identified. The latter are strategically located to act as government and
economic service centres within the surrounding service hinterland
areas, and act as attractors of urban consolidation. Service Towns
(CSIR Settlement Typology, 2018) form the bulk of the identified Rural
Service Centres.
B3.3 Identification of regional networks of
consolidated and well-connected rural
service centres
Rural service centres (see Table A1 below) across South Africa were
identified to provide a select network of towns that play a strategic
regional service role within their regions. They were identified on the
basis of (1) the CSIR, 2018 Town Area Typology, (2) regional
accessibility, and (3) recently developed priority towns for social
investment within the DRDLR Rural Social Facility Toolkit project.
The town area typology is also being used in the identification of
potential regional roles for medium and small towns in support of
SALGA’s Small Town Regeneration Strategy. Furthermore, the role of
towns informs the Integrated Urban Development framework
Implementation: SALGA Small Town Strategy. Identified points of
growth and/or existing development should act as points of settlement
consolidation in rural areas especially in areas of high value
agricultural and ecological infrastructure.

B4. Spatial Logic for Natural Resource
Production and Selection Resource
Production areas (As used in NSDF Sub- Frame 3)
B4.1 Spatial Logic
Central to the spatial logic of the National Resource Production
Regions Sub-Frame 2 are the following:  Maintenance of national agricultural heartlands in the interests of
national food security;  The prioritisation of lower order agricultural development areas that
exhibit greater cumulative levels of spatial advantage in terms of:  Agricultural productivity, crop suitability and viability;  Proximity to existing consumption and production chains;  Accessibility to higher order settlement typologies;  Accessibility to supporting agricultural infrastructure;  High population densities;  Effective agricultural development through agrarian and land
reform will require recognition of and concerted efforts around
the following: o Realigning and combining models of agrarian and land
reform at a policy level; o Defining the role of land reform as an instrument to facilitate
land access and security of tenure for agricultural
development; o Optimising the role of stakeholder-based land reform; o Steering land reform policy towards boosting productive
land use among the rural poor;
o Renewing the emphasis on ‘transformation-from-below’ for
widespread grassroots impact on poverty and
unemployment; o Facilitating the conversion of underutilized land in
communal areas into small scale and/or commercial
production; o Incorporating indigenous knowledge systems for agriculture
in traditional areas in a way that factors traditional spatial
relationships between settlement and agricultural practice; o Using a spatial targeting approach that factors in the
contextual and comparative advantages of region and
place; o Picking and supporting commercial agriculture sectors and
regions that have the highest potential for growth and
employment; o Focusing on strategic agricultural development areas
where expanded irrigation is possible through improved
water management and new water schemes; o Focusing support on agricultural development areas that
have a comparative advantage in terms of proximity and
access to production and consumption chain networks,
e.g. Regional Development Anchors, Rural Service Centres;
and
o Providing strategic developmental support for potential
new production and consumption chains in dense rural
hinterlands.24

B4.2 Spatial Description of Production
Heartland, Agri-Enterprise Regions and
Eco-Resource Production Regions (as
used in NSDF Sub-Frame 3)
Resource Production Heartland Areas
The frame firstly refers to a central “Heartland” which includes all
identified high value production and high potential agricultural land in
the central part of the country (as used in Figures 9 and 14 of the main
NSDF document and seen in Figure A8 and A9 below). This region is also
characterised by high intensity mining production in selected areas.
The agricultural area is identified based on the following inputs: (1) a
crop fields layer from the National Department of Agriculture, and (2)
the Land Capability data (2018), provided by the National Department
of Agriculture.25
Crop fields with a land capability index value of 8 and more were
selected to represent intermediate to high value agriculture land in the
country. The National Department of Agriculture’s process of updating
this data layer, was used to guide the demarcation of the high value
production areas (see Figure A9). Figure A9: High Value Agriculture Areas in Central Heartland and Agri- Enterprise Regions (Land Capability Layers considered as input)

 Availability of sources of water, e.g. located downstream from
as schools, health facilities and social support services;
Factors considered amongst others proximity of social facilities such

Agri-Enterprise Resource Regions26
Cognizance should be taken of the broad spectrum of agricultural
activity in South Africa, and the need for differentiated responses at
each level. Levels of agricultural activity in this regard are represented
in the pyramid on the following pages. This spectrum of agricultural
activity is categorised according to scale and intensity of production,
ranging from large commercial producers at the peak to smaller scale
producers towards the base.
Key to the approach considered is a small-scale farming model,
indicative of a ‘transformation-from-below’ approach; one that is
espoused by a variety of specialists and academics on the topic of
agrarian reform in South Africa. A potentially renewed emphasis on
transformation-from-below for agrarian reform will require a spatially
differentiated and targeted approach that factors both contextual
and comparative advantages of region and place (Figure A9). Viable
small scale farming and transformation from below was thus a key input
in shaping and identifying significant “agri-enterprise resource regions”
Spatial Description of Natural -Resource Production and
Livelihood Regions
There are areas that need to play a key role in resource economies as
well as management of national ecological infrastructure – with
specific land-development and management implications.
These are areas that are nationally significant for ecological as well as
“resource critical regions” for other purposes such as mining,
agriculture, energy, settlements, heritage and tourism areas.
The areas are typically under stress from an ecological perspective.
They are under pressure in terms of their resilience, but also in terms of
the impact of development and risk to critical biodiversity areas (CBA1)
and associated ecological service areas such as Strategic Water
Source Areas (SWSA).
The Resource Production and Livelihood Regions are characterised by
the prominence of Strategic Water Service Areas (SWAs), which
contribute significantly to the overall water supply of the country – not
merely to the region itself. These areas are our water factories, supporting growth and
development needs that are often a long distance from the SWSAs
themselves. Land uses that reduce stream flow or affect water quality
(e.g. mining, sprawling settlements, plantations, overgrazing) should be
avoided in SWSAs; wetlands should be kept in good condition or
rehabilitated, and invasive alien plants should be cleared.
The areas provide unique opportunities for agri-enterprises, eco- enterprises, and activities including small scale arming, wildlife
ranching, marine economies, tourism and restoration related job
creation opportunities.

 National Fresh Water Protected Areas (Water bodies).

Areas
Management and productive use of Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs)
(Figure A12) and Strategic Water Source (SWS) areas (Figure 12) and
National Fresh Water Bodies (Figure 13) have been identified as Priority
National Ecological Infrastructure Regions that are of national
importance and development.
Figure A12: Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBA1)
Source: SANBI 2018.
Figure A13: Strategic Water Source Areas, National Fresh Water Bodies
Source: SANBI 2018.
The Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) contribute significantly to the
overall water supply of the country. They are identified in Atlas of
Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas in South Africa (Nel et al, 2011). The
World Wild Life Fund’s 2015 report on SWSAs provide detail descriptions
of individual SWSAs.33
In the Southern and West Coast region and the Central heartland
areas, these areas largely coincide with high productive agricultural,
urban growth, mining activities and critical bio-diversity areas. Along
the eastern coast and inland areas and in the north of the country,
strategic water source areas have to be managed within productive
agriculture, densely settled and also traditional settlement areas.
Management of these areas needs to consider restoration, green
enterprise and service delivery, tourism and game farming activities.
Strategic Groundwater Areas in the central and arid regions are critical
for many towns that are dependent on scarce groundwater sources.
The system of National Fresh Water Bodies and management guidelines
is set out in the Implementation manual for freshwater ecosystem
priority areas (see Driver A., Nel JL., Snaddon K., Murray K., Roux DJ., Hill
L., Swartz ER., Manuel J. and Funke N. (2011) Report No. 1801/1/11,
Water Research Commission, Pretoria). B6.3 Spatial Illustration of Significant Inter-Basin
Water Transfer Lines
Nationally significant inter-basin water transfer lines and dependent
cities were identified and indicated as can be seen in Figure A13.34

B6.4 Additional Spatial Description of National
Resource Risk Areas (NSDF Sub-Frame 5)
National resource risk areas (see Figure A14) are both (1) nationally
significant and (20 under stress from an ecological perspective, but are
also “resource critical regions” for other sectors such as mining, energy,
agriculture and human settlement. These areas are under pressure in
terms of their resilience, but also in terms of the impact of development
and risk to Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBA1) and associates ecological
service areas as well as high quality water production. Priority Focus Areas: Stressed Catchments with densely populated
Strategic Water Source Areas
Strategic Focus Areas: The risks associated with interregional
interdependencies are clearly evident in significant national scale
ecological core “competition areas”, which in general show high levels
of pollution. The critical areas for short term intervention in this regard
are in the:  Upper Vaal region (Mpumalanga) (SWSA, coal mining, high
potential agricultural land);  Lower Vaal (Gauteng, Free State) (SWSA, water supply for Gauteng,
coal mining, industry, high potential agricultural land and
expanding settlements);  Greater uMngeni region (KZN) (water supply for Ethekwini, intensive
agriculture, expanding settlements);  Waterberg region (Limpopo) (mining, water and future expansion
driven as national priority);
 Olifants Water Management Area (Mpumalanga and Limpopo)
(big irrigation scheme, major water quality issues, mining pressure);
and
 Berg and Breede River Catchments (WC) (high value agriculture
and settlements but with low absorptive capacity for pollution). Figure A14 Stressed catchments within areas of competing land-use
Source: SANBI-2018. Stressed Catchments of concern due to
competition for use.36
The Mpumalanga Coal Mining and Coal-Fired Power Plant region will
be under increased pressure for environmental considerations, possible
decline in demand in coal and large scale employment under threat.
Coal Fired Power Station Dependency on Water Transfers. The Lower
Vaal Catchment is highly polluted and both the Upper and Lower
catchments are key water providers to the Gauteng Metropolitan
region which is the area of highest economic production in the country.
These areas require (1) enhanced management of water over use and
distribution as well as radical action and clean up with regard to
pollution management, (2) regional economic diversification and
transition, and (3) shared forecasting, phasing, pro-active and regional
scale economic transition planning, scenario development and
enterprise development between multiple role players and institutions.
