EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
  Vision Statement

We, the people of South Africa, have journeyed
far since the long lines of our first democratic
election on 27 April 1994, when

we elected a government for us all.

We began to tell a new story then. We have

lived and renewed that story along the way.

Now in 2030 we live in a country

which we have remade.

We have created a home where everybody
feels free yet bounded to others; where
everyone embraces their full potential.

Weare proud to bea community that cares.

We have received the mixed legacy of
inequalities in opportunity and in where we

have lived, but we have agreed to change our

 

narrative of conquest, oppression, resistance,
  

We felt our way towards a new sense of
ourselves:
© Trying, succeeding and making mistakes
© Proclaiming success and closing our
minds to failure
© Feeling orientated and disorientated
through our own actions
© Affirming some realities and denying
others
© Proclaiming openness to the world, yet
courting insularity
©. Eager to live together, yet finding it
difficult to recognise shared burdens
© Learning to recognise and acknowledge

shared successes.

Our new story is open ended with temporary
destinations, only for new paths to open up

once more.

It is a story of unfolding learning.
Even when we flounder, we remain hopeful.

In this story, we always arrive and depart.

We have come some way.

We know:

What we do, and how we do it, is as important
as what we want to achieve.

What we are, is because of who we have been
and what we want to become.

We will continue to make it to make us,

because we are happy with being who we are.

Who are we?

We are Africans.

We are an African country.

We are part of our multi-national region.

We are an essential part of our continent.
Being Africans, we are acutely aware of the
wider world, deeply implicated in our past and
present.

That wider world carries some of our

inheritance.

Our work brings us ever closer to our dreams.
Work grounds our dreams even the more
fantastic they are.

The reality of work connects us to our

dreams.

We work towards goals with patience invested
in actual effort.

We invest in our efforts and are not waiting in
disengaged expectation.

Because we are impatient to succeed, we work

with painstaking rigour.

Our efforts, not so much those of others,
make us stronger.

Then we are patient for the results of our
efforts.

This kind of patience, gives birth to our new

work ethic.

We are inevitably and intimately implicated in

 

 

one another.

We all assist the institutions we have creatively
redesigned to meet our varied needs; we reach
out across communities to strengthen our
resolve to live with honesty, to be set against

corruption and dehumanising actions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7
 We have made the rules by which we want
ourselves to live:

© We hold the Constitution of our
country as the covenant guide to a fair society

© Since 1994 we've changed our laws to
obey our Constitution

© Now we live it: justice rules us, because
just laws make community possible

© The law enables us to live together
fulfilling our mutual obligations and

responsibilities in the shared public spaces of

 

 

our mutual affiliation.

We know that those to whom we have given
the privilege to govern our land, do so on our

behalf and for the benefit of all the people.

Government begins in the home, grows into
the community, expands towards the city, flares
toward the province, and engulfs the entire

land.

We know our leaders as we have elected them
and pledged them into office:
© They are wise in the use of our wealth
O Wise in knowing and understanding our
wishes and needs
© Wise in expecting us to express
ourselves to them in any appropriate
manner we have agreed to be allowable
O Wise in not silencing those who criticise,
but enable them, through our rules of
engagement, to be even more rigorous in

supporting a just society.

 

8 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 
  

Our leaders’ wisdom is ours, because we sense
our wisdom in theirs.

© They do more than respond to us:

© They bring new thoughts and ideas

© They share with us what they think

© They inspire us, because we then seek to

aspire with them
© With them we renew our world

continuously.

But our gift of leaders extends far beyond
politics.

We have them in abundance in every avenue of
life.

We have come far with our cultural, religious,
and ancestral traditions.

Contemporary citizens that we are, we are
conscious of the intimate relationships

between tradition and change.

We say to one another: ! cannot be without
you, without you this South African community
is an incomplete community, without one
single person, without one single group, without

the region or the continent, we are not the

 

best that we can be..

land is to commensurate with our desired

values.

South Africa belongs to all its peoples.

Now, in 2030, our story keeps growing as if
spring is always with us.

Once, we uttered the dream of a rainbow.
Now we see it, living it. It does not curve over
the sky.

It is refracted in each one of us at home, in
the community, in the city, and across the

we know: there will always be, for us, a worthy
future.

INTRODUCTION

The National Development Plan aims to eliminate

poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. South Africa

can realise these goals by drawing on the energies of

its people, growing an inclusive economy, building

capabilities, enhancing the capacity of the state, and
promoting leadership
and partnerships

throughout society.

survive and flourish if the mass of

our people remain in poverty,
without land, without tangible
prospects for a better life.
Attacking poverty and deprivation
must therefore be the first priority

of a democratic government.”

The Reconstruction and Development

South Africa has made
remarkable progress in
the transition from
apartheid to democ-
racy. This transition has
been peaceful despite
the country's history of
violent conflict and

dispossession.

Programme, 1994

14

 

In nearly every facet of

life, advances are being

made in building an
inclusive society, rolling back the shadow of history
and broadening opportunities for all. South Africa
has been able to build the institutions necessary for
a democratic and transformative state. The
Constitution enshrines a rights-based approach and
envisions a prosperous, non-racial, non-sexist
democracy that belongs to all its people. Healing
the wounds of the past and redressing the inequities
caused by centuries of racial exclusion are constitu-
tional imperatives. Access to services has been
broadened, the economy has been stabilised and a
non-racial society has begun to emerge. Millions
who were previously excluded have access to
education, water, electricity, health care, housing
and social security. About 3 million more people are
working today than in 1994, the poverty rate has
declined and average incomes have grown steadily

inrealterms.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

Eighteen years into democracy, South Africa
remains a highly unequal society where too many
people live in poverty and too few work. The
quality of school education for most black learners is
poor. The apartheid spatial divide continues to
dominate the landscape. A large proportion of
young people feel that the odds are stacked against
them. And the legacy of apartheid continues to
determine the life opportunities for the vast
majority. These immense challenges can only be
addressed through a step change in the country's

performance.

To accelerate progress, deepen democracy and
build a more inclusive society, South Africa must
translate political emancipation into economic
wellbeing for all. It is up to all South Africans to fix the

future, starting today.

This plan envisions a South Africa where everyone
feels free yet bounded to others; where everyone
embraces their full potential, a country where
opportunity is determined not by birth, but by
ability, education and hard work. Realising such a
society will require transformation of the economy
and focused efforts to build the country's capabili-
ties. To eliminate poverty and reduce inequality, the
economy must grow faster and in ways that benefit

all South Africans.

In particular, young people deserve better
educational and economic opportunities, and
focused efforts are required to eliminate gender
inequality. Promoting gender equality and greater
opportunities for young people are integrated

themes that run throughout this plan.
 BACKGROUND

President Jacob Zuma appointed the National Planning Commission in May 2010 to

draft a vision and national development plan. The Commission is an advisory body

consisting of 26 people drawn largely from outside government, chosen for their

expertise in key areas.

The Commission’s Diagnostic Report, released in June 2011, set out South Africa’s

achievements and shortcomings since 1994. It identified a failure to implement policies

and an absence of broad partnerships as the main reasons for slow progress, and set

out nine primary challenges:

|. Too few people work

. Corruption levels are high

wo ON Do RW NY

. South Africa remains a divided society.

. The quality of school education for black people is poor

. Infrastructure is poorly located, inadequate and under-maintained
. Spatial divides hobble inclusive development

. The economy is unsustainably resource intensive

. The public health system cannot meet demand or sustain quality

. Public services are uneven and often of poor quality

South Africans from all walks of life welcomed the diagnostic as a frank, constructive

assessment. This led to the development of the draft national plan, released in

November 2011. Building on the diagnostic, the plan added four thematic areas: rural

economy, social protection, regional and world affairs, and community safety.

The Commission consulted widely on the draft plan. Our public forums drew in

thousands of people; we met with parliament, the judiciary, national departments,

provincial governments, development finance institutions, state-owned entities and local

government formations; and we held talks with unions, business, religious leaders and

non-profit organisations.

South Africans have broadly supported the draft plan, proposing modifications and

making suggestions to implement it effectively. Their input has informed this plan.

National development has never been a linear
process, nor can a development plan proceed in a
straight line. Accordingly, we propose a multidi-
mensional framework to bring about a virtuous
cycle of development, with progress in one area

supporting advances in others.

How will this work in practice? South Africa's
principal challenge is to roll back poverty and
inequality. Raising living standards to the minimum
level proposed in the plan will involve a combina-
tion of increasing employment, higher incomes

through productivity growth, a social wage and

 good-quality public services. All of these challenges
are interlinked. Improved education, for example,
will lead to higher employment and earnings, while
more rapid economic growth will broaden
opportunities for all and generate the resources

required to improve education.

The graphic below demonstrates the close link
between capabilities, opportunities and employ-
ment on social and living conditions. It shows how
leadership, an active citizenry and effective
government can help drive development in a

socially cohesive environment.

The plan focuses on the critical capabilities needed
to transform the economy and society. Achieving
these capabilities is not automatic, nor will they
emerge if the country continues on its present
trajectory. Rising levels of frustration and impatience
suggest that time is of the essence: failure to act will
threaten democratic gains. In particular, South Africa
must find ways to urgently reduce alarming levels of
youth unemployment and to provide young people

with broader opportunities.

16 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

 

Progress over the next two decades means doing
things differently. Given the complexity of national
development, the plan sets out six interlinked
priorities:
Uniting all South Africans around a common
programme to achieve prosperity and equity.
O Promoting active citizenry to strengthen
development, democracy and accountability.
Bringing about faster economic growth,
higher investment and greater labour
absorption.
Focusing on key capabilities of people and the
state.
Building a capable and developmental state.
Encouraging strong leadership throughout

society to work together to solve problems.

Moving ahead with the plan

This is a plan for South Africa. It provides a broad
strategic framework to guide key choices and
actions. Its success will depend on all South Africans
taking responsibility for the plan, led by the

President and Cabinet.

This overview is a high-level summary of the plan.
The |5 chapters address the major thematic areas
in detail, providing evidence, recommendations

and clear implementation frameworks.

Following publication of the plan, the Commission
will focus on:
Mobilising society to support the plan, and
exploring a social compact to reduce poverty
and inequality through investment and
employment.
Conducting research on critical issues
affecting long-term development.
Advising government and social partners on
implementing the plan.
Working with relevant state agencies to

report on the progress of the objectives.
 The Commission believes that to build a better

South Africa, we must start today.

Growth and jobs, education and skills, anda
capable and developmental state

While the achievement of the objectives of the
National Development Plan requires progress on a

broad front, three priorities stand out:

structural impediments, such as poor-quality
education or spatial settlement patterns that
exclude the majority. These are essential to
achieving higher rates of investment and competi-
tiveness, and expanding production and exports.
Business, labour, communities and government will
need to work together to achieve faster economic

growth.

patterns, the country’s progress will be turbulent

 

 

and tenuous.

AN APPROACH TO CHANGE: ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AND ACTIVE CITIZENRY

The plan draws extensively on the notion of capabilities.
Key capabilities that emerge from development literature include:
© Political freedoms and human rights

Social opportunities arising from education, health care, public transport and other public services

°

© Social security and safety nets

© An open society, transparency, disclosures and a culture of accountability

°

Economic facilities, work, consumption, exchange, investment and production.

Alongside hard work and effort, capabilities and the opportunities that flow from development enable
individuals to live the lives to which they aspire. A developmental state builds the capabilities of people to
improve their own lives, while intervening to correct historical inequalities. Neither government nor the

market can develop the necessary capabilities on their own.

Citizens have the right to expect government to deliver certain basic services, and to hold leaders
accountable for their actions. They also have responsibilities to other citizens, including mutual respect,
tolerance and abiding by the laws of the land. Leaders throughout society have to balance the power they
hold with responsibility, including listening to and tolerating different and diverse views, promoting social

cohesion and working together to resolve problems.
Making the plan work will require a complex interplay of actors and actions, and progress in any one area is

almost always dependent on progress in another. The plan will provide a common focus for action across all

sectors and sections of South African society.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17
 18

 

To accelerate development, South Africa needs the
active support of all citizens, leadership in all sectors
that puts the country's collective interests ahead of
narrow, short-term goals, and radically improved
government performance. In some _ instances,
policy change may be necessary, but in most areas it
is about getting the basics right, implementing
government programmes, holding people
accountable for their actions and finding innovative

solutions to complex challenges.

Direct and immediate measures to attack

poverty

The plan presents a long-term strategy to increase
employment and broaden opportunities through
education, vocational training and work experi-
ence, public employment programmes, health and
nutrition, public transport and access to informa-
tion. While there are “quick wins” to be achieved in
each of these areas, the strategies will take time to
have a large-scale effect on poverty. To reduce the
acute effects of poverty on millions of South Africans

over the short term, the plan proposes to:

Introduce active labour market policies and
incentives to grow employment, particularly
for young people and in sectors employing
relatively low-skilled people.

Expand public employment programmes to
| million participants by 2015 and 2 million
by 2020. As the number of formal- and
informal-sector jobs expands, public work
programmes can be scaled down.
Strengthen primary health-care services and
broaden district-based health programmes,
such as the community health worker and
midwife programmes, and health education.
Expand welfare services and public employ-
ment schemes, enabling the state to service
and support poor communities, particularly
those with high levels of crime and violence.

° Introduce a nutrition programme for

pregnant women and young children and
extend early childhood development
services for children under five.

oO Improve the quality of education in
underperforming schools and further
education and training colleges.

oO Promote mixed housing strategies and more
compact urban development to help people
access public spaces and facilities, state
agencies, and work and business opportuni-
ties.

Invest in public transport, which will benefit
low-income households by facilitating

mobility.

DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND
EXTERNAL DRIVERS OF CHANGE

South Africa's development is affected by what
happens in the region and the world. Success will
depend on the country's understanding and
response to such developments. In addition to a
detailed scan of demographic projections, the plan
discusses five notable trends: global economic
shifts, technology, globalisation, climate change and

African economic growth.

Demographic trends

What will South Africa look like in 2030? The
country has reached a stage in its demographic
transition where birth rates are falling and the
population is stabilising. This transition has profound
implications for population structure, the rate of
growth of the labour force, and demand for services

such as education and health.

Today the labour force (those aged | 5 to 64) makes
up 64 percent of the population, with the propor-
tion of children and the elderly comprising smaller
shares. Internationally, demographic profiles such as
these are often associated with rising incomes,
faster productivity growth, higher savings and rising

living standards. Alternatively, they can lead to a
 frustrating and destabilising environment where
young people cannot get work, contributing to
violence, crime, alcohol abuse and other social ills.
The determinant of success is whether a country
can harness the advantage of having a large number

of young people who are able and willing to work.

 

‘To do so means providing them with education and
skills, and helping school leavers find work that is
stimulating and through which they can fulfil their

aspirations.

Birth rates for white South Africans began to fall in
the 1950s and 1960s, while birth rates for Africans
began falling in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In
both cases, rising urbanisation and better educa-
tional standards were decisive factors. Today, South
Africa's population is growing at | percent a year
and by 2030, it is projected to grow by 0.5 percent

ayear.

Our observations include the following:

©. The proportion of South Africans living in rural
areas has fallen by about |0 percentage points
since 1994. Today, about 60 percent of the
population lives in urban areas. In line with
global trends, the movement of people from
the countryside to the cities is expected to
continue, and by 2030 about 70 percent of the

population will live in urban areas. Gauteng and

 

the cities of eThekwini and Cape Town are the
fastest-growing city-regions, with implications
for planning and delivery of basic services.

© Immigration is projected to add between
0.1 percent and 0.2 percent a year to the rate
of population growth in the period to 2030.

© HIV/AIDS has had a profound effect on the
population, raising overall deaths significantly
since 2000 and reducing the proportion of
women of child-bearing age. There are signs
that the country has begun to turn the corner in
response to an effective education and
treatment campaign. The HIV infection rate has
stabilised at about 10 percent. New infections
among young people have fallen and life
expectancy is rising. Despite these gains, there
will still be a sizeable number of AIDS orphans
and children requiring concerted support from
the state and communities for decades to

come.

To maximise the benefits of this “demographic
dividend” the country requires better nutrition and
health care, improved educational standards,
increased access to further and higher education,
easier entry into the labour market and greater
labour mobility (the ability to move to where jobs
are on offer). All of these factors need to be taken

into account in national planning.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BUILDING A FUTURE FOR SOUTH AFRICA’S YOUTH

South Africa has an urbanising, youthful population. This presents an opportunity to
boost economic growth, increase employment and reduce poverty. The Commission,
recognising that young people bear the brunt of unemployment, adopted a “youth lens”

in preparing its proposals, which include:

© Aniutrition intervention for pregnant women and young children.

© Universal access to two years of early childhood development.

© Improve the school system, including increasing the number of students achieving
above 50 percent in literacy and mathematics, increasing learner retention rates to

90 percent and bolstering teacher training.

0

Strengthen youth service programmes and introduce new, community-based

programmes to offer young people life-skills training, entrepreneurship training and

opportunities to participate in community development programmes.

© Strengthen and expand the number of FET colleges to increase the participation rate
to 25 percent.

© Increase the graduation rate of FET colleges to 75 percent.

© Provide full funding assistance covering tuition, books, accommodation and living
allowance to students from poor families.

© Develop community safety centres to prevent crime and include youth in these
initiatives.

© A tax incentive to employers to reduce the initial cost of hiring young labour-market
entrants.

© Assubsidy to the placement sector to identify, prepare and place matric graduates
into work. The subsidy will be paid upon successful placement.

© Expand learnerships and make training vouchers directly available to job seekers.

© A formalised graduate recruitment scheme for the public service to attract highly
skilled people.

© Expand the role of state-owned enterprises in training artisans and technical

professionals.

 

Policy ina dynamic global environment

International and regional developments affect
South Africa in complex ways. Our view is that on
balance, global trends can have positive implications
for South Africa's development, notwithstanding
several notable risks. Understanding and respond-
ing appropriately to complex global challenges is

the first task of planning.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

Achanging global economy

Long-term shifts in global trade and investment are
reshaping the world economy and international
politics. Chief among these developments is the
emergence of rapidly growing economies,
particularly China, India and Brazil. After nearly
three centuries of divergence, inequality between
nations is decreasing. Urbanisation and industrialis-

ation in China and India are likely to keep demand
 for natural resources relatively high for a decade or
more. The emergence of more consumers in
developing countries will broaden opportunities for

all economies.

In decades to come, as emerging economies
increase their share of world trade and investment,
the relative decline in the economic weight of the
United States, Europe and Japan will have concomi-
tant effects on their political and military influence.
This could lead to a reorganisation of the interna-
tional diplomatic and governance architecture,

reflecting new centres of influence.

South Africa can benefit from rapid growth in
developing countries that leads to increased
demand for commodities and expanding consumer
markets. At the same time, these trends pose
challenges for middle-income countries as a result
of greater competition in manufacturing and certain
information technology-enabled services. The rise
of emerging markets also increases international
competition, placing downward pressure on the

wages of low-skilled workers in tradable sectors.

Over the past five years, South Africa's exports to
advanced economies have slowed in response to
lower demand. This decline has been offset by
increased demand from Asia and higher prices for
commodities. While South Africa has maintained a
reasonably sound trade balance, owing largely to
high commodity prices, it is of concern that high
value-added and labour-intensive exports are

slowing.

Inthe medium term, South Africa has to respond to
this trend by bolstering competitiveness and
investment in high value-added industries and
increasing the volume of mineral exports. Over the
longer term, South Africa has to do more to
enhance competitiveness in areas of comparative

advantage that can draw more people into work. By

 

improving the skills base and increasing competi-
tiveness, the economy can diversify, offsetting the
distorting effects of elevated commodity prices on

the rand.

It is likely that world economic growth over the
next decade will be lower than it was during the
previous one. This will require greater policy focus,
effective implementation of industrial policies and

improved skills development.

Globalisation

Globalisation broadly refers to rising global trade
and increased flows of people, capital, ideas and
technologies across borders in recent decades.
These trends have generally supported the
development of poor and middle-income
countries, enabling them to access markets, goods,
services, capital, technology and skills. Globalisation
has also contributed to a growing “interconnected-
ness” that has lowered barriers to entry and

expanded the reach of knowledge.

Yet globalisation has also contributed to heightened
risk and complexity in world affairs — from financial
market volatility, to the migration of skilled people
from developing countries, to changing power
relations between states and capital. As a result of
these patterns, the current economic slowdown in
developed countries poses a significant risk to

developing countries.

South Africa's experience of globalisation includes
tangible benefits and increased complexity. The
challenge is to take advantage of opportunities while
protecting South Africans — especially the poor —
from the risks associated with new trade and
investment patterns. For example, South Africa has a
low level of savings and relies on foreign capital to
finance its investments. Dependence on external
capital flows increases the risk of volatility in the

domestic economy. Slower growth in developed

countries has been accompanied by strong demand
from developing countries, contributing to a wel-
come rebalancing of the country's exports. Yet this
trend also poses a challenge for policy makers and
manufacturers, because present demand from em-
erging markets is weighted towards commodities

and raw materials, rather than a more diversified

basket of products required by developed countries.

      

 

The economies of many African countries have
grown more rapidly over the past decade,
significantly reducing extreme poverty for the first
time in about half a century, and the continent has

carved outa greater voice in global institutions.

On the political front, democracy has made uneven
headway. The recent uprisings in North Africa are a
stark reminder of the risks of poor governance and
weak institutions that allow elites to accumulate

wealth at the expense of the people.

Strong African growth also provides opportunities

for South African firms and industries, which have

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

contributed to development by investing in
telecommunications, banking, mining, construction
and retail. Closer partnership between countries,
firms and people would deepen economic and
social integration, contributing to higher rates of

growth and development.

Several structural weaknesses must be overcome if
Africa is to translate rapid growth and higher
demand for commodities into rising
employment and living standards.
Crucially, poor transport links and
infrastructure networks, as well as
tariff and non-tariff barriers, raise the
cost of doing business and hobble
both investment and internal trade.
Weak legal institutions and, in some
cases, poor governance heighten the
risks of investing. The picture is improv-
ing steadily, but challenges remain,
including in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC),
which faces hurdles related to
infrastructure, trade barriers and
governance. While South Africa will find it
difficult to compete in low-skills manufactur-

ing because of its high cost structure, many
countries on the continent can compete as

production costs rise in East Asia.

Several of South Africa’s challenges can only be
addressed through regional cooperation. While
South Africa is a water-scarce country, several
neighbouring countries have abundant supply.
There are other areas in which complementary
national endowments offer opportunities for
mutually beneficial cooperation. For example,
South Africa should invest in and help exploit the
wide range of opportunities for low-carbon energy
from hydroelectric and other clean energy sources

in southern Africa.
 Climate change

Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases are changing the earth’s climate, potentially
imposing a significant global cost that will fall
disproportionately on the poor. Rising tempera-
tures, more erratic rainfall and extreme weather
events are likely to take a heavy toll on Africa, with
an increased spread of tropical diseases and
growing losses (human and financial) from droughts
and flooding. Climate change has the potential to
reduce food production and the availability of
potable water, with consequences for migration

patterns and levels of conflict.

South Africa is not only a contributor to greenhouse
gas emissions — it is also particularly vulnerable to
the effects of climate change on health, livelihoods,
water and food, with a disproportionate impact on
the poor, especially women and children. While
adapting to these changes, industries and house-
holds have to reduce their negative impact on the
environment. This will require far-reaching changes

to the way people live and work.

The impact of climate change is global in scope and
global solutions must be found, with due consider-

ation to regional and national conditions.

Technological change

Science and technology continue to revolutionise
the way goods and services are produced and
traded. As a middle-income country, South Africa
needs to use its knowledge and innovative products
to compete. On its own, amore competitive cost of
production will not be sufficientto expand the global
presence of South African industry. This applies to
both new industries and traditional sectors, such as
mining. Innovation is necessary for a middle-

income country to develop.

Science and technology can also be leveraged to

solve some of the biggest challenges in education

 

and health. Many parts of Africa that have never
enjoyed fixed-line telephony are widely served by
efficient cellular phone networks that provide a
range of services. Educational materials can be
delivered electronically to remote villages. Science
is breaking new frontiers in fighting diseases and

lowering the cost of water purification.

Today, about |7 percent of South Africa’s popula-
tion is able to access the internet — a number that is
rising by about 20 percent a year. The use of digital
communications has changed society in ways that
are not yet fully understood. It is clear, however,
that young people have embraced the new media,
and this represents a potentially powerful means of

fostering social inclusion.

South Africa needs to sharpen its innovative edge
and continue contributing to global scientific and
technological advancement. This requires greater
investment in research and development, better
use of existing resources, and more nimble

institutions that facilitate innovation and enhanced

 

cooperation between public science

   
 
 
 
 
  
  
  

and technology institutions and the
private sector. The high domestic cost
of broadband internet connectivity is a
major hindrance. All South Africans should
be able to acquire and use knowledge
effectively. To this end, the institutional
arrangements to manage the
information, communications and
technology (ICT) environment need
to be better
structured to
ensure that
South Africa
does not fall
victim to a

“digital divide”.

 The National Development Plan is a broad strategic
framework. It sets out a coherent and holistic
approach to confronting poverty and inequality
based on the six focused, interlinked priorities

summarised below.

Uniting South Africans around a common
programme

The Constitution provides a vision of a united,
prosperous, non-racial and non-sexist society; a
country that belongs to all who live in it, united in its
diversity. The Constitution also obliges the country
to heal the divisions of the past, recognising that
South Africa emerged from a system where the

majority of its citizens were robbed of opportunity.

These dual imperatives are prerequisites for
successful national development. Uniting South
Africa is both an essential input into the process of
reducing poverty and inequality and a direct
outcome of successful poverty reduction. To build a
socially cohesive society, South Africa needs to
reduce poverty and inequality by broadening
opportunity and employment through economic
inclusion, education and skills, and specific redress
measures; promote mutual respect and inclusive-
ness by acting on the constitutional imperative that
South Africa belongs to all who live in it, and that all
are equal before the law; and deepen the apprecia-
tion of citizens’ responsibilities and obligations

towards one another.

The struggle against apartheid was first and fore-
most about the construction of a non-racial and non-
sexist democratic society, in which all people have
equal rights. Despite consistent progress since 1994,
South Africa remains a divided society, with race still
forming the main divide. Individual stereotyping of
race and ethnicity is widespread and discrimination
persists. The country’s institutional framework and
its broad economic and social trends have contrib-

uted to gradual deracialisation, but progress is not

 

sufficient or deep enough. Although progress has
been made to improve the lives of women;
discrimination, patriarchal attitudes and poor access
to quality education persists. The plan deals with
these factors holistically, recognising that key
priorities such as education or rural development

will have the biggest impact on poor women.

South Africa's own history and the experiences of
other countries show that unity and social cohesion
are necessary to meet social and economic
objectives. The preamble to the Constitution
captures this balance best. It recognises the
obligation of the state to reverse the effects of
apartheid, in a context where all citizens feel part of

the country and its programmes.

Achieving and maintaining this balance requires the
confluence of several factors, not all of which are
under government's control. A growing economy,
rising employment and incomes, falling inequality, an
improving education system, fertile conditions for
entrepreneurship and career mobility will contribute
significantly to uniting South Africa's people.
Programmes such as affirmative action, black
economic empowerment and land reform are most
effective when the economy is growing and the
education system is improving. Without such an
environment, these measures can raise the level of
social tension. This plan makes several proposals to
improve the efficacy of redress programmes,
especially those relating to broadening economic

opportunities for the historically disadvantaged.

Our nation building effort has been more difficult in
periods of slower economic growth. South Africa
cannot afford a downward spiral that sharpens social
tensions. Strong leadership is needed to promote
the vision of the Constitution. A formal social
compact may help to strengthen the alignment
between growth, development and nation building,

generating a virtuous circle.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ARTS, CULTURE, ECONOMY AND SOCIETY

Arts and culture open powerful spaces for debate about where a society finds itself and

where it is going. Promoted effectively, the creative and cultural industries can contribute

substantially to small business development, job creation, and urban development and

renewal.

South Africa’s music industry was worth R2.2 billion in sales in 2011; the craft sector

contributed R3.3 billion to GDP in 2010 and employs more than 273 000 people; and the

visual arts sector has a turnover of nearly R2 billion. The country’s rich cultural legacy and

the creativity of its people mean that South Africa can offer unique stories, voices and

products to the world. In addition, artistic endeavour and expression can foster values,

facilitate healing and restore national pride.

Effective measures to promote the arts include:

© Providing financial and ICT support to artists to enable the creation of works expressing

national creativity, while opening space for vibrant debate.

Strengthening the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa’s mandate

for nation building and value inculcation.

Incentivising commercial distribution networks to distribute and/or host art.

°

schools with appropriate educator support.

Developing and implementing plans for a more effective arts and culture curriculum in

© Supporting income-smoothing for artists in a special unemployment insurance scheme

and evaluating funding models for such initiatives.

© Developing sectoral determination legislation frameworks to protect arts-sector

employees.

In addition to measures that promote social equity
outlined elsewhere, we propose the following:
The Bill of Responsibilities, developed by the
Department of Basic Education and others,
should be popularised, encouraging every-
one to live the values of the Constitution.
A pledge based on the Constitution's
preamble should be developed and used in
school assemblies. The preamble should be
displayed in all workplaces.
All South Africans should be encouraged to
learn an African language and government
programmes should work to make this a
reality.

The Commission on Gender Equality and

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

the Ministry for Women, Children and
People with Disabilities should jointly set
clear targets for the advancement of
women's rights and report on progress
annually.

Employment equity and other redress
measures should be made more effective by
focusing on the environment in which
capabilities are developed.

The country should continuously seek to
improve the efficacy of black economic
empowerment models.

Redress measures in the workplace should
focus on enterprise development, access to

training, career mobility and mentoring.
 Citizens active in their own development
In many respects, South Africa has an active and
vocal citizenry, but an unintended outcome of
government actions has been to reduce the
incentive for citizens to be direct participants in their
own development. To prevent this practice from
being entrenched, the state must actively support
and incentivise citizen engagement and citizens
should:
Actively seek opportunities for advance-
ment, learning, experience and opportunity.
Work together with others in the community
to advance development, resolve problems
and raise the concerns of the voiceless and
marginalised.
Hold government, business and all leaders in

society accountable for their actions.

Active citizenry and social activism is necessary for
democracy and development to flourish. The state
cannot merely act on behalf of the people — it has to
act with the people, working together with other
institutions to provide opportunities for the

advancement of all communities.

All sectors of society, including the legislatures and
judiciary, have to ensure that the fruits of develop-
ment accrue to the poorest and most marginalised,
offsetting possible attempts by elites to protect their
own interests at the expense of less-powerful

communities.

Legislation provides numerous avenues for citizens
to participate in governance beyond elections.
Forums such as school governing bodies, ward
committees, community policing forums and clinic
committees provide voice to citizens and opportu-
nities to shape the institutions closest to them.
Communities can also participate in drafting local
government plans. Despite these avenues, there is
growing distance between citizens and the

government. Outbreaks of violence in some

 

community protests reflect frustration not only over
the pace of service delivery, but also concerns that

communities are not being listened to sincerely.

Better communication, more honesty anda greater
degree of humility by those in power would go a
long way towards building a society that can solve

problems collectively and peacefully.

Citizens have a responsibility to dissuade leaders
from taking narrow, short-sighted and populist
positions. Robust public discourse and a culture of
peaceful protest will contribute to a deeper
understanding of the challenges facing communities
and reinforce accountability among elected officials.
For example, if learning outcomes in a school are
below their legitimate expectations, a community
can help to remedy the situation by strengthening
school governance, ensuring that learners and
teachers are punctual, and that the support

structures from public officials are effective.

 

Civil society promotes development and commu-

nity cohesion. In many poor

    
 
 
    
  
 

communities, welfare non-
governmental organisations
(NGOs) and other commu-
nity-based organisations

deliver vital

programmes.

More work needs to be
done to emphasise the
responsibilities that citizens
have in their own develop-
ment and in working with others in

society to resolve tensions and challenges. The
refrain, “sit back and the state will deliver” must be
challenged — it is neither realistic nor is it in keeping

with South Africa's system of government.

ELEMENTS OF A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING

Income, through employment or social security, is critical to defining living standards, but

human beings need more than income. They need adequate nutrition, they need transport

to get to work, and they desire safe communities and clean neighbourhoods. These

elements require action either from individuals, government, communities or the private

sector.

The National Development Plan makes a firm commitment to achieving a minimum

standard of living which can be progressively realised through a multi-pronged strategy. In

this plan, we do not define that minimum standard of living but we do provide a framework

for the adoption of a minimum standard of living by society. This approach is consistent with

the Commission’s view that the achievement of such a floor would require support and

participation from all social partners and hence its definition is left for ongoing work of the

Commission.

The following picture illustrates the approach.

This approach to defining living standards in a

holistic way is consistent with the
capabilities approach advanced by the
Commission. The approach focuses on
the key capabilities that individuals need
to live the life that they desire. Of these
capabilities, education and skills, and the

opportunity to work are the elements

where South Africa most needs to make progress.

Faster and more inclusive economic

growth

An economy that will create more jobs

South Africa needs an economy that is more
inclusive, more dynamic and in which the fruits of
growth are shared equitably. In 2030, the economy
should be close to full employment, equip people
with the skills they need, ensure that ownership of
production is more diverse and able to grow
rapidly, and provide the resources to pay for

investment in human and physical capital.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

South Africa displays features of a low-growth,
middle-income trap, characterised by lack of
competition, large numbers of work seekers who
cannot enter the labour market, low savings (hence
a reliance on foreign capital inflows) and a poor skills
profile. Many of these features are rooted in the
evolution of the economy over the past | 50 years.
The net effect is a high levels of unemployment and

inequality, and low levels of investment.

Transforming this economy is a challenging, long-

term project. In summary, we propose to enhance
 human capital, productive capacity and infrastruc-
ture to raise exports, which will increase resources
for investment and reduce reliance on capital
inflows. Higher investment, supported by better
public infrastructure and skills, will enable the
economy to grow faster and become more
productive. Rising employment and productivity
will lead to rising incomes and living standards and
less inequality. Shifting the economy towards more
investment and lower consumption is necessary for

long-term economic prosperity.

Employment scenarios prepared by the
Commission suggest that most new jobs are likely
to be sourced in domestic-orientated businesses,
and in growing small- and medium-sized firms.
While most jobs are not created directly in
exporting firms, the sectors that are globally traded
tend to have more potential to stimulate domestic
spin-offs. Given South Africa’s low savings rate and
the need to invest at a higher rate, it is important to
grow exports and expand output in those sectors.
South Africa's trade profile has not fulfilled either of
these objectives over the past 15 years. Making
progress will mean intensifying the country's global
presence in areas of competitive advantage, while

building the necessary infrastructure and skills.

Economic growth needs to accelerate in a more
inclusive manner. These are twin imperatives.
Government's New Growth Path aims to create 5
million new jobs between 2010 and 2020. It seeks
to do so by providing a supportive environment for
growth and development, while promoting amore
labour-absorbing economy. Its proposals are
intended to lower the cost of living for poor
households and for businesses through targeted
microeconomic reforms, especially in transport,
public services, telecommunications and food.
Lowering the cost of living is a necessary adjunct to
raising the standard of living and encouraging

investment; it will also facilitate the call for wage

 

moderation at both the middle and top end of the

income spectrum.

The Commission believes that the country can
create | | million jobs by 2030 by:
Improving economic policy coordination and
implementation
Building partnerships between the public
sector, business and labour to facilitate, direct
and promote investment in labour-intensive
areas
Raising competitiveness and export earnings
through better infrastructure and public
services, lowering the costs of doing
business, improving skills and innovation, and
targeting state support to specific sectors
Strengthening the functioning of the labour
market to improve skills acquisition, match
job seekers and job openings, and reduce

conflict.

Meeting the objectives of the plan requires
leadership to drive implementation, and to
convince South Africans of the need to make mutual
sacrifices for longer-term benefits. It will also require
a change in the structure of the economy and the
pace at which it grows. The crisp question is how.
‘Transforming the economy and creating sustainable
expansion for job creation means that the rate of
economic growth needs to exceed 5 percent a year
onaverage. To bring this about we propose:
Increasing exports, focusing on those areas
where South Africa already has endowments
and comparative advantage, such as mining,
construction, mid-skill manufacturing,
agriculture and agro-processing, higher
education, tourism and business services.
A more efficient and competitive infra-
structure. Infrastructure to facilitate
economic activity that is conducive to growth
and job creation. An approach will be

developed to strengthen key services such as

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

28
 30

 

commercial transport, energy, telecommu-
nications and water, while ensuring their
long-term affordability and sustainability.
Reducing the cost of living for low-income
and working-class households. Inequality
and poverty can be addressed by raising
incomes through productivity growth and
reducing the cost of living. A commitment to
a minimum living standard will ensure that all
households can meaningfully participate in
the economy. The costs of food, commuter
transport and housing must be reduced,
while raising the quality of free or low-cost
education and health care.

Reduced cost of regulatory compliance,
especially for small- and medium-sized firms.
A larger, more effective innovation
system, closely aligned with firms that
operate in sectors consistent with the growth
strategy.

Support for small businesses through
better coordination of relevant agencies,
development finance institutions, and public
and private incubators.

An expanded skills base through better
education and vocational training.
Strengthened financial services to bring
down their cost and improve access for
small- and medium-sized businesses.

A commitment to public and private
Procurement approaches that stimulate
domestic industry and job creation.

A higher rate of investment, with public-
sector investment crowding in private
investment. This will depend on partnerships
with the private sector, policy certainty and
building confidence in the long-term growth
ofthe economy.

A labour market that is more responsive
to economic opportunity. This requires
lifelong learning and career advancement;

stabilising the labour environment; strength-

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

ening dispute resolution institutions;
reviewing regulations and standards for small
and medium enterprises; addressing public
sector labour relations; strengthening the
application of minimum standards among
employers, recruitment agencies and
brokers; strengthening active labour market
policies and labour matching; and enabling
skilled immigration.

Enhanced commercial diplomatic services
to support the expansion of South Africa’s

global market share.

These objectives complement the goals set out in

the New Growth Path.

Increasing economic growth to above 5 percent a
year will require business and labour to endorse a

shared vision.

South Africa has to act on the fact that millions of
able-bodied people want to work. In the short
term, the economy needs to create jobs for
unemployed South Africans, many of whom are
young and low-skilled, while upgrading skills and
knowledge for a different economy in future.
Raising employment levels will have benefits
beyond the empowering experience of having a
job. It will help people invest in their children’s
education, upgrade their homes and manage life’s
risks. Work and education will enable citizens to

improve their own lives.

It is essential to lower the cost of living for poor
households. Some elements of the plan will have a
cost-raising effect on the economy. In particular,
modernising infrastructure after decades of
underinvestment may require higher tariffs. To
offset these increases, policy should focus on
increasing competitiveness and investing in new
infrastructure in areas that directly affect the poor,

such as the food value chain, public transport,
 education and health, and telecommunications.
Greater public-sector efficiency will also lead to a

lower cost structure for the economy.

A contentious issue is whether South Africa can
mobilise unemployed people into production for
export markets. Some argue that the economy is
not competitive in labour-intensive manufacturing
because the cost structure is too high, the exchange
rate is too volatile, infrastructure is inadequate and
the skills base is too limited. Yet South Africa could
compete in a range of categories should these
concerns be addressed — and in large part, they can
be addressed. Exchange-rate volatility creates a
barrier to success and the plan proposes that
resolving domestic resource costs and skills
availability would have a more sustained impact on
costs. As a middle-income country, South Africa has
to compete on the basis of excellent products and
brands, and effective entry into global distribution
channels. This will require greater commitment to
research and development and its commerciali-
sation, an efficient logistics platform and effective

economic diplomacy.

In moving towards decent work for
all, the short-term priority must be to
raise employment and incentivise the
entry of young people into the labour
market, while taking due care to prevent
substitution or the diminution of existing
working conditions. Some work opportunities
may not enable individuals to immediately live
the lives that they desire. To promote sustainable
livelihoods, it is important that individuals or
families, irrespective of income, can access services
such as quality education, health care or public
transport. Itis also important for a person who loses
their job to be able to access work from public
works programmes or community-based employ-
ment schemes. In these ways, public policy and

public action complements individual effort in the

 

labour market, providing sustainable livelihoods to

the working poor.

Difficult choices will have to be made. To promote
large-scale job creation, the functioning of the
labour market will have to improve. The
Commission makes proposals aimed at helping
young people get into the labour market, easing
rules for small businesses, reducing tension and
conflict, and clarifying dismissal and misconduct
procedures. More attention also needs to be given
to continuous training for existing workers and to

providing career paths for all workers.

The role of public employment initiatives, such as
the expanded public works programme, should
also be considered. Even if South Africa achieves
GDP growth above 5 percent a year and employ-
ment rises rapidly over the next decade, there

will still be aneed for such programmes.

Transforming the economy also means changing
patterns of ownership and control. To date, efforts
to transfer ownership of productive assets have not
yielded the desired results, with employee share
ownership schemes playing a less significant role. A

bolder approach and clearer targets are required.

 Policy instruments to encourage the private sector
to change ownership patterns include voluntary
scorecards, procurement regulations, licensing
arrangements (such as in telecommunications and

mining) and development finance.

There is a need to improve the effectiveness of the
instruments mentioned above, with an understand-
ing of the trade-offs that exist. In addition, more
emphasis is needed to support small businesses,
encourage government and the private sector to
procure from small firms, and to enhance the
development of black and female managers and
professionals. A rapidly growing economy that is
diversifying into new sectors will open up opportu-
nities for black-owned firms and smaller businesses,

promoting inclusive growth.

South Africa has to exploit its strengths to increase

 

exports. If the economy is less competitive in one

area, it will have to do better

advantages

proximity to fast-
growing African markets,
high-quality universities and a modern, productive
agricultural sector. South Africa also has companies
that are global leaders in sectors like civil construc-

tion.

South Africa holds large global shares in platinum

group metals, gold, diamonds, manganese, coal,

32 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

 

iron ore and uranium. Yet over the past decade,
domestic mining has failed to match the global
growth trend in mineral exports due to poor
infrastructure, alongside regulatory and policy
frameworks that hinder investment. South Africa
can benefit greatly from Asia's growing demand for
commodities. To do so means improving water,
transport and energy infrastructure, and providing
greater policy and regulatory certainty to investors.
This will enable the mining sector to deploy the
skills, resources, know-how and capital that are
available, and allow government to raise much

more tax revenue than it does at present.

There are important trade-offs to be considered in
mineral beneficiation. South Africa is losing global
market share in products such as ferrochrome.
How-ever, first-stage processing or smelting is highly
energy and capital intensive, potentially drawing
energy and capital away from other sectors. South
Africa should be selective about the areas in which it
intends to support first-stage beneficiation. Priority
areas should include those where suitable capacity
already exists, or where beneficiation is likely to lead
to downstream manufacturing. Beneficiating all of the
country’s minerals is neither feasible nor is it essential

for developing a larger manufacturing sector.

Over the next several years the world economy is
expected to grow at a modest pace. In these
circumstances, South African businesses need to
think carefully about what they produce, for which
markets, using what capabilities. As a small open
economy, South Africa can develop niche products.
Capturing a small share of global demand in areas
where local firms can compete can have a big
impact. For example, South Africa could be a global
leader in manufactured goods and services for the
mining industry, where it has substantial know-how.
This would make an important contribution to

industrialisation in a global niche market.
 Regional economic integration can boost economic
growth in all countries in southern Africa. The
region has grown rapidly over the past decade, with
strong performances in minerals, agriculture, tele-
communications and tourism. Achieving economic
integration requires identifying practical opportuni-
ties where cooperation can offer mutual benefits;
investment in infrastructure; strengthening regional
trade-blocs; lowering tariffs; and addressing non-

tariff barriers, such as inefficient border posts.

South Africa needs to implement its economic

policy priorities effectively. Coordination failures,

 

split accountability and overlapping mandates

hinder the implementation of existing policies.

Long-term growth and investment requires a
shared vision, trust and cooperation between
business, labour and government. Today, the level
of trust is low, and labour relations have become
unduly tense (and sometimes violent). It is
inconceivable that the economy will evolve in a
more labour-intensive manner if these conditions
persist. Promoting more rapid, job-creating growth
means tackling these tensions in an honest and

open manner.

WOMEN AND THE PLAN

Women make up a large percentage of the poor, particularly in rural areas. The plan takes

gender — along with race and geographic location — into account, proposing a range of

measures to advance women's equality. In summary, our recommendations along these lines

are as follows:

© Public employment should be expanded to provide work for the unemployed, with a

specific focus on youth and women.

© The transformation of the economy should involve the active participation and

empowerment of women.

© The role of women as leaders in all sectors of society should be actively supported.

© Social, cultural, religious and educational barriers to women entering the job market

should be addressed. Concrete measures should be put in place and the results should

be evaluated over time. Access to safe drinking water, electricity and quality early

childhood education, for example, could free women from doing unpaid work and help

them seek jobs.

© By 2030, people living in South Africa should have no fear of crime. Women, children

and those who are vulnerable should feel protected.

© Security of tenure should be created for communal farmers, especially women.

The Department of Health should design and pilot a nutrition intervention programme
for pregnant women and young children.

Coverage of antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive persons requiring such drugs
should be expanded, alongside treatment of high-risk HIV-negative persons. Effective

microbicides should be offered routinely to all women 16 years and older.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aninclusive and integrated rural economy

South Africa’s rural communities should have
greater opportunities to participate fully in the
economic, social and political life of the country,
supported by good-quality education, health care,
transport and other basic services. Successful land
reform, job creation and rising agricultural produc-
tion will contribute to the development of an

inclusive rural economy.

South Africa’s hinterland is marked by high levels of
poverty and joblessness, with limited employment
inagriculture. The apartheid system forced much of
the African population into barren rural reserves.
The result was an advanced and diversified
commercial farming sector relying on poorly paid
farm labour, and impoverished, densely populated
communities with limited economic opportunities

and minimal government services.

To change this, we propose a multifaceted

approach:
Creating more jobs through agricultural
development, based on effective land reform
and the growth of irrigated agriculture and
land production.
Providing basic services that enable people to
develop capabilities to take advantage of
opportunities around the country, enabling
them to contribute to their communities
through remittances and skills transfer.
Developing industries such as agro-
processing, tourism, fisheries and small

enterprises where potential exists.

Institutional capacity is integral to the success of this
approach, including reforms to address contested
relationships between traditional and constitutional

bodies.

Building capabilities

Atacountry level, critical capabilities include legal

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

and other institutions, infrastructure (telecommuni-
cations, water, energy and transport), the education
and training system, sustainable management of the
environment, systems of innovation and patterns of
spatial development. Human capabilities include
education, health, social protection and community

safety.

Improving infrastructure

Infrastructure is not just essential for faster eco-
nomic growth and higher employment. It also
promotes inclusive growth, providing citizens with
the means to improve their own lives and boost
their incomes. Infrastructure is essential to

development.

Investment spending in South Africa fell from an
average of almost 30 percent of GDP in the early
1980s to about 16 percent of GDP by the early
2000s. Public infrastructure spending is also at low
levels by historical standards. In effect, South Africa
has missed a generation of capital investment in
roads, rail, ports, electricity, water, sanitation, public
transport and housing. To grow faster and in a more
inclusive manner, the country needs a higher level
of capital spending. Gross fixed capital formation
needs to reach about 30 percent of GDP by 2030,
with public sector investment reaching 10 percent
of GDP to realise a sustained impact on growth and

household services.

Both the public and private sectors can play
important roles in building infrastructure, including
bulk infrastructure. In the wake of the 2009
recession, the private sector has been reluctant to
invest its healthy levels of retained earnings in
productive capacity. At the same time, the public
sector has favoured consumption over investment.
Acknowledging this, the government has
announced a shift in the composition of expenditure
towards investment, a necessary precondition to

breaking the stalemate. Over time, public-sector
 investment can help crowd in private investment.

The Commission's recommendations on eco-
nomic infrastructure cover financing, planning and

maintenance.

Who pays for economic infrastructure? Some types
ofinfrastructure provide broad social and economic
benefits. But playing catch-up means that charges
have to increase in the short to medium term to
make services financially viable. The fact that one
new power station (producing 4 800MW of
electricity) costs about twice the entire depreciated
capital stock of existing power stations (producing
40 O00MW) illustrates the challenge. Moreover,
high levels of joblessness and inequality make some
of these services unaffordable for most people

unless they are subsidised.

The Commission's view is that in the long term,
users must pay the bulk of the costs for economic
infrastructure, with due protection for poor
households. The role of government and the fiscus
is to provide the requisite guarantees so that the
costs can be amortised over time, thereby
smoothing the price path. The state must also put in
place appropriate regulatory and governance
frameworks so that the infrastructure is operated
efficiently and tariffs can be set at appropriate levels.
For infrastructure that generates financial returns,
debt raised to build facilities should be on the
balance sheets of state-owned enterprises or
private companies that do the work. Guarantees
should be used selectively to lower the cost of
capital and to secure long-term finance. Subsidies to
poor households should be as direct and as
transparent as possible. Social infrastructure that
does not generate financial returns — such as schools

or hospitals —should be financed from the budget.

The electricity crisis of 2008 and other recent

developments have exposed institutional weak

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
     

nesses related to state-owned companies
responsible for network infrastructure. Averting
such problems requires clear institutional arrange-
ments, transparent shareholder compacts, clean
lines of accountability and sound financial models to
ensure sustainability. We make recommendations
in each of these areas. Laws that govern regulation
are often confusing, conflating policy with regula-

tion. We propose ways to fix this.

For infrastructure that supports human settlements
(housing, water, sanitation, roads, parks and so on)
the picture is unnecessarily complicated. The
planning function is located at local level, the
housing function is at provincial level, and the
responsibility for water and electricity provision is
split between those responsible for bulk services
and reticulation. In practice, these arrangements do
not work, In general, human settlements are badly
planned, with little coordination between those
installing water reticulation infrastructure and those
responsible for providing bulk infrastructure.
Responsibility for housing should shift to the level at

which planning is executed: the municipal level. The

 

plan sets out recommendations for effective urban

development.

Local government faces several related
challenges, including poor capacity, weak
administrative systems, undue political
interference in technical and administra-
tive decision-making, and
uneven fiscal capacity. The
Commission believes that
within the framework of the
Constitution, there is more
room for the asymmetric
allocation of powers and
functions and for more
diversity in how develop-
mental priorities are

implemented. To achieve

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 35
 36

 

this, longer-term strategies are needed, including
addressing capacity constraints, allowing more
experimentation in institutional forms and working
collaboratively with national and provincial

government.

Compared with the best international standards,
South Africa's ICT infrastructure is abysmal. Efficient
information infrastructure that promotes economic
growth and greater inclusion requires a stronger
broadband and telecommunications network, and
lower prices. The economic and employment

benefits outweigh the costs.

The following infrastructure investments should be
prioritised:

Upgrading informal settlements on suitably
located land.

Public transport infrastructure and systems,
including the renewal of the commuter rail
leet, supported by enhanced links with road-
based services.

Developing the Durban-Gauteng freight
corridor, including a new dug-out port on the

site ofthe old Durban airport.

 

Building a new coal line to unlock coal
deposits in the Waterberg,
extending existing
coal lines in the
central basin and
upgrading the
coal line to Richards
Bay and the iron ore
line to Saldanha.
Developing,

in a timely
manner, several
new water schemes
to supply urban and industrial centres,
new irrigation systems in the
Umzimvubu river basin and Makatini

Flats, and a national water conserva-

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

tion programme to improve water use and
efficiency.

Constructing infrastructure to import
liquefied natural gas and increasing explora-
tion to find domestic gas feedstock (including
investigating shale and coal bed methane
reserves) to diversify the energy mix and
reduce carbon emissions.

Procuring at least 20 OOOMW of renewable
electricity by 2030, importing electricity from
the region, decommissioning | | OOOMW of
ageing coal-fired power stations and stepping
up investments in energy-efficiency.
Establishing national, regional and municipal
fibre-optic networks to provide the
backbone for broadband access. Private
investment needs to lead the way in this area,
complemented by public funds required to
meet social objectives. Effective policies,
regulation and institutional arrangements to

achieve this are urgently required.

 

In implementing these infrastructure priorities, it is
important to ensure that rural communities can

benefit from both bulk and

  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 

reticulation infrastructure
and that the pricing of this
infrastructure is sensitive the

needs of rural communities.

Reversing the spatial
effects of apartheid
Apartheid left a terrible
spatial legacy. While about
3.2 million households have
benefited from new housing,
and services and infrastructure have
been provided
to many
commun
ities, limited

progress has been made in reversing
 entrenched spatial inequities. In some instances,
post-1994 policies have reinforced the spatial
divides by placing low-income housing on the

periphery of cities.

Reshaping South Africa’s cities, towns and rural
settlements is a complex, long-term project,
requiring major reforms and political will. It is,
however, a necessary project given the enormous
social, environmental and financial costs imposed by

existing spatial divides.

The Commission proposes a national focus on
spatial transformation across all geographic scales.
Policies, plans and instruments are needed to
reduce travel distances and costs, especially for
poor households. By 2030, a larger proportion of
the population should live closer to places of work,
and the transport they use to commute should be
safe, reliable and energy efficient. This requires:
Strong measures to prevent further
development of housing in marginal places
Increased urban densities to support public
transport and reduce sprawl
More reliable and affordable public transport
and better coordination between various
modes of transport
Incentives and programmes to shift jobs and
investments towards the dense townships
onthe urban edge
Focused partnerships with the private sector

to bridge the housing gap market.”

Rural areas present particular challenges. Over
one-third of South Africa's population live in the
former “homelands”, and a large proportion of this
group is economically marginalised. Policies are
required to bring households in these areas into the
mainstream economy. There are rural areas,
however, where transport links are good and
where densification is taking place in the absence of

effective land-use management and urban

 

governance. These require urgent interventions.

Our proposals to create vibrant urban settlements

and revive rural areas include:
Establishing new norms and a national spatial
framework.
Integrating diffuse funding flows into a single
fund for spatial restructuring.
Reviewing the housing grant and subsidy
regime to ensure that the instruments used
are aligned with positive changes in human
settlement policy.
Reforming the planning system to resolve
fragmented responsibility for planning in
national government, poorly coordinated
intergovernmental planning, disconnects
across municipal boundaries and the
limitations of integrated development plans.
Strengthening government's planning
capabilities.
Developing neighbourhood spatial compacts
to bring civil society, business and the state
together to solve problems.
Enabling citizens to participate in spatial

visioning and planning processes.

Building environmental sustainability and
resilience

Since the late I9th century, South Africa has
exploited its mineral wealth with little or no regard
for the environment. Changes are needed to
protect the natural environment while allowing the
country to benefit from its mineral deposits. In
addition to significant non-renewable mineral
wealth, the country’s natural resources include its
adjacent oceans, soil, water, biodiversity, sunshine

and along coastline.

From an environmental perspective South Africa
faces several related challenges, some of which are
in conflict. The country needs to:

Protect the natural environment in all

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

37
 38

 

respects, leaving subsequent generations
with at least an endowment of at least equal
value.

Enhance the resilience of people and the
economy to climate change.

Extract mineral wealth to generate the
resources to raise living standards, skills and
infrastructure in a sustainable manner.
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and

improve energy efficiency.

We propose three measures to protect the

country’s natural resources:
An environmental management framework.
Developments that have serious environ-
mental or social effects need to be offset by
support for improvements in related areas.
A target for the amount of land and oceans
under protection (presently about 7.9
million hectares of land, 848km of coastline
and 4 |72km2 of ocean are protected).
A set of indicators for natural resources,
accompanied by publication of annual
reports on the health of identified resources

to inform policy.’

Climate change is already having an impact on
South Africa, with marked temperature and rainfall

variations and rising sea levels.

Research suggests that it is possible to both reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from electricity produc-
tion and still grow the minerals and mineral
processing sectors. The general approach is based
on the following key proposals:
Implement the 2010 Integrated Resource
Plan (procuring at least 20 OOOMW of
electricity from renewables) to reduce
carbon emissions from the electricity
industry from 0.9kg per kilowatt-hour to
0.6kg per kilowatt-hour.

Improve the energy efficiency of mining and

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

mineral processing by 15 percent by 2030.
This might include closing down the most

energy-inefficient plants.

The Integrated Resource Plan imposes an effective
shadow price on carbon. Complementary fiscal
reforms are needed to broaden the price on carbon
to encourage economy-wide efficiency and

investment in greener technologies.

Over the short term, policy needs to respond
quickly and effectively to protect the natural
environment and mitigate the effects of climate
change. Over the long term, with realistic, bold
strategies and global partnerships, South Africa can
manage the transition to a low-carbon economy at
a pace consistent with government's public pledges,

without harming jobs or competitiveness.

Improving the quality of education

The quality of education for most black children is
poor. This denies many learners access to employ-
ment. It also reduces the earnings potential and
career mobility of those who do get jobs — and limits

the potential dynamism of South African businesses.

By 2030, South Africa needs an education system
with the following attributes:
High-quality, universal early childhood
education
Quality school education, with globally
competitive literacy and numeracy standards
Further and higher education and training
that enables people to fulfil their potential
An expanding higher-education sector that
can contribute to rising incomes, higher
productivity and the shift to a more knowl-
edge-intensive economy
A wider system of innovation that links
universities, science councils and other
research and development role players with

priority areas of the economy.
 SPORT AND HEALTHY LIVING

Sport plays an important role in promoting wellness and social cohesion. The plan treats

sport as a cross-cutting issue, with related proposals in the chapters on education, health

and nation building.

Sport and physical education are an integral part of a child’s development. The Department

of Basic Education and the Department of Sports and Recreation have taken important steps

to reintroduce sport in schools. This should be expanded so that all schools develop and

maintain infrastructure for at least two sports.

All communities should have access to sports facilities and encourage the formation of

amateur leagues. The outdoor gym in Soweto is an innovative initiative that could be

replicated in many communities. Local authorities can also promote exercise by ensuring

that urban roads have proper pavements, developing cycle lanes and installing traffic-calming

measures.

The plan proposes an initiative to encourage South Africans to walk, run, cycle or play team

games on the second Saturday of every month. The extensive network of formal and

informal sporting clubs can be mobilised to organise these events.

Expanding opportunities for participation in sports will help to ensure sports teams

represent all sectors of society. It will also ensure that South Africa produces results that

match its passion for sport.

Improving the quality of education requires careful
management, support from all interested parties
and time. According to a 2010 study of reform in
20 education systems around the world, sound
approaches begin to produce results about six years
after reforms are initiated, with sustained dividends

emerging over the longterm.

There has been significant progress in education
since 1994. Before 1990, less than a quarter of
black learners completed matric. In 20! 2, this figure
is close to two thirds. South Africa has made rapid
progress in broadening preschool education and
almost 8 million children receive a meal at school.

School funding is pro-poor, with falling class sizes in

 

each province. Yet despite reforms introduced
since 2009, especially those relating to testing
learners and supporting teacher development,
challenges still remain. Urgent action is required on

several fronts:

Households and communities. Proper
nutrition and diet, especially for children under
three, are essential for sound physical and mental
development. The Commission makes recom-
mendations on child nutrition, helping parents and
families to break the cycle of poverty, and providing
the best preparation for young children — including a
proposal that every child should have at least two

years of preschool education.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 40

 

Management of the education system.
Reducing layers of bureaucracy would make more
resources available to support schools and
teachers. The general rule of thumb is that
interventions, both supportive and corrective, need
to be inversely proportional to school perfor-
mance. In this way, better-performing schools can
be given the freedom to get on with the job, as long
as there is measurable improvement. We make
specific recommendations focused on_ better
support to schools, delivering the basic necessities
for a good education and measuring the right things.
We propose a campaign to improve infrastructure

in poor schools, especially in rural areas.

Competence and capacity of school
principals. The common feature of all well-run
schools is leadership. The Department of Basic
Education has recently launched a programme to
measure the competencies of principals and deputy
principals. This survey will also help identify weak
performers, based on learner scores, and allow for
appropriate support for principals and teachers.
Principals should be selected purely on merit, be
given greater powers over school management and

be held accountable for performance.

Teacher performance. Our proposals cover
training, remuneration, incentives, time on task,
performance measurement, and content and
pedagogical support. Professionalism and the
conditions that enhance professional conduct must
be rebuilt, and accountability for performance
needs to be enhanced. This means that professional
development, peer review, school infrastructure,
the provision of learner support materials and
teacher support systems need to be strengthened.
Teachers, both individually and at school level,
should be held accountable for learner perfor-
mance, with due recognition of the learning

environment.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

Further education and training (FET). The
FET system is not effective. It is too small and the
output quality is poor. Continuous quality improve-
ment is needed as the system expands. The quality
and relevance of courses needs urgent attention.
When quality starts to improve and the employabil-
ity of graduates begins to increase, demand for FET
services will rise automatically. Simply growing the
sector without focusing on quality is likely to be
expensive and demoralising for young people,
further stigmatising the system. By 2030, the FET
sector should cover about 25 percent of the age-
relevant cohort, implying an increase from about
300 000 today to |.25 million by 2030.

Higher education. The performance of
existing institutions ranges from world-class to
mediocre. Continuous quality improvement. is
needed as the system expands at a moderate pace.
A major challenge is that poor school education
increases the cost of producing graduates, and a
relatively small number of black students graduate
from universities. Increasing participation and
graduation rates, with the option of a four-year
university degree, combined with bridging courses
and more support for universities to help black
students from disadvantaged backgrounds, is likely

to yield higher returns.

Research and development (R&D). A
simultaneous focus on R&D and on the calibre of
teaching would improve the quality of higher
education, but without attention, inadequate
human capacity will constrain knowledge produc-
tion and innovation. Universities need to become
centres of excellence at the cutting edge of
technology. By attracting students from abroad,
universities can generate revenue and increase the
skills pool. Students from abroad who graduate
from South African universities should qualify for a
seven-year work permit to encourage them to stay

and work here. While South Africa needs to spend
 more on R&D in general, the institutional setup also
needs to improve the link between innovation and
business requirements. Government should
partner with the private sector to raise the level of
R&D, with resources targeted towards building the
research infrastructure required by a modern

economy.

for all

   

ality health
Long-term health outcomes are shaped by factors
largely outside the health system: lifestyle, diet and
nutritional levels, education, sexual behaviour,
exercise, road accidents and the level of violence.
The Commission makes recommendations in each
of these areas. Priority areas include sex education,
nutrition, exercise, and combating smoking and
alcohol abuse. These are social responsibilities that
deserve to be taken seriously by every citizen, and

promoted by families and institutions.

Good health is essential for a productive and fulfilling
life. The Diagnostic Reportdemonstrates the starkly

interrelated challenges posed by a crumbling health

system and a rising disease burden. South Africa's

 

broken public health system must be fixed. While
greater use of private care, paid for either by users
or health insurance, is part of the solution, it is no
substitute for improving public health care. A root-
and-branch effort to improve the quality of care is
needed, especially at primary level.

By 2030, the health system should provide quality
care to all, free at the point of service, or paid for by
publicly provided or privately funded insurance.
The primary and district health system should
provide universal access, with a focus on preven-
tion, education, disease management and
treatment. Hospitals should be effective and
efficient, providing quality secondary and tertiary
care for those who need it. More health profession-
als should be on hand, especially in poorer

communities.

Reform of the public health system should focus on:
Improved management, especially at
institutional level
More and better-trained health professionals
Greater discretion over clinical and adminis-

trative matters at facility level, combined with

 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

 

41
 42

 

effective accountability

Better patient information systems support-
ing more decentralised and home-based
care models

A focus on maternal and infant health care.

At institutional level, health-care management is in
crisis. The Department of Health has recently
launched a programme to evaluate management
competence. Complementary reforms should
include greater delegation of authority over staffing,

shift structures and routine procurement.

A district-based approach to primary health care is
part of the pilot phase of national health insurance.
For this approach to be successful, the health
system needs more personnel (including profes-
sionals and paramedics), new forms of manage-
ment authority, and strengthened statutory

structures for community representation.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic has illustrated South
Africa's ability to make monumental social and
political mistakes — as well as its ability to correct

them and implement a complex programme

 

effectively. The health system’s success in managing
the epidemic over the past five years is commend-
able. Yet there is no room for complacency. There
is a continuing need for education, prevention,
testing and treatment. Lowering the rate of new
infections will reduce the demand on the public
health system. Yet even if there are no new
infections, there will still be a sizeable number of
HIV-positive people requiring treatment, posing
continuing challenges for the tuberculosis infection
rate and the risk of drug-resistant HIV strains
developing. The epidemic and its implications for
public policy are likely to persist for at least another

generation — possibly two.

Building a national health insurance system is an
important objective. There are four prerequisites to
its success: improving the quality of public health
care, lowering the relative cost of private care,
recruiting more professionals in both the public and
private sectors, and developing a health information
system that spans public and private health
providers. These reforms will take time, require
cooperation between the public and private

sectors, and demand significant resources.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

Disability and poverty operate in a vicious circle. Disability often leads to poverty and

poverty, in turn, often results in disability. People with disabilities face multiple

discriminatory barriers.

Disability must be integrated into all facets of planning, recognising that there is no one-size-

fits-all approach.

In line with the priorities of the plan, people with disabilities must have enhanced access to

quality education and employment. Efforts to ensure relevant and accessible skills

development programmes for people with disabilities, coupled with equal opportunities for

their productive and gainful employment, must be prioritised.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030
    

Social protection
Social protection brings social solidarity to life and
ensures a basic standard of living. It also plays an
important role in helping households and families
manage life’s risks, and eases labour market trans-

itions, contributing to a more flexible economy.

By 2030, South Africa should have a comprehen-
sive system of social protection that includes social
security grants, mandatory retirement savings, risk
benefits (such as unemployment, death and

disability benefits) and voluntary retirement savings.

Part of our approach to social protection is through
a social wage, which includes no-fee schools, free
basic services and subsidised public transport. In
addition to creating more jobs in the private sector,
a significant broadening of public employment
programmes will also help to ensure that fewer

households live below a determined income level.

To achieve the objectives of broader social security

coverage, we propose the following:
An acceptable minimum standard of living
must be defined, including what is needed to
enable people to develop their capabilities.
The retirement savings and risk benefit gap
should be closed through reforms, including
mandatory contributions, with consideration
given to subsidising these contributions for
low-income or periodic workers.
Social welfare services should be expanded,
with more education and training for social
work practitioners and a review of funding
for non-profit organisations.
Public employment should expand, with a
focus on youth and women. It is expected
that public employment will provide the
equivalent of 2 million full-time jobs by 2020.
A commitment to household food and
nutrition security involving public- and

private-sector action.

 

 

By 2030, people living in South Africa should feel
safe and have no fear of crime. Women, children
and vulnerable groups should feel protected. They
should have confidence in the criminal justice
system to effectively apprehend and prosecute
criminals who violate individual and community
safety. The South African Police Service and metro
police should be professional institutions staffed by
skilled, disciplined, ethical individuals who value

their work and serve the community.

Achieving this vision requires targeted action in five
key areas:
Strengthening the criminal justice system.
This requires cooperation between all
departments in the government's justice,
crime prevention and security cluster. The
recommendations in the Review of the
South African Criminal Justice System will go
a long way in addressing the system's current
weaknesses.
Making the police service professional.
The police code of conduct and code of
professionalism should be
linked to promo-

tion and

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

    

43
  

44

 

 

discipline in the service. Recruitment should
attract competent, skilled professionals
through a two-track system; one for
commissioned officers and one for non-
commissioned officers.
Demilitarising the police service. The
decision to demilitarise the police force,
moving away from its history of brutality, was
a key goal of transformation after 1994. The
remilitarisation of the police in recent years
has not garnered greater respect for the
police or higher conviction rates. If anything,
it has contributed to violence. The police
should be demilitarised
and managed
towards a

professional

service.
Adopting an

means

tackling the fundamental
causes of criminality, which requires a wide
range of state and community resources.
Building community participation. Civil
society organisations and civic participation
are needed to establish safe communities.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

A capable and

Developmental state

Towards better governance

Aplanis only as credible as its delivery mechanism is
viable. There is a real risk that South Africa’s
developmental agenda could fail because the state is
incapable of implementing it. The Commission
makes far-reaching institutional reform proposals to
remedy the uneven and often poor performance of

the public service and local government.

A developmental state tackles the root causes of
poverty and inequality. A South African develop-
mental state will intervene to support and guide
development so that benefits accrue across society
(especially to the poor), and build consensus so that
long-term national interest trumps short-term,

sectional concerns.

A developmental state needs to be capable, but a
capable state does not materialise by decree, nor
can it be legislated or waved into existence by
declarations. It has to be built, brick by brick,
institution by institution, and sustained and
rejuvenated over time. It requires leadership,
sound policies, skilled managers and workers, clear
lines of accountability, appropriate systems, and

consistent and fair application of rules.

Policy instability is a concern. While there are cases
where policy must change, government often
underestimates the disruptive effect of major policy
adjustments on service delivery. A balance has to be

struck and at present that balance is missing.

To achieve the aspiration of a capable and develop-
mental state, the country needs to enhance
Parliament's oversight role, stabilise the political-
administrative interface, professionalise the public
service, upgrade skills and improve coordination. It
also needs a more pragmatic and proactive

approach to managing the intergovernmental
 system to ensure a better fit between responsibility
and capacity. Equally, the state needs to be prepared
to experiment, to learn from experience and to
adopt diverse approaches to reach common

objectives.

‘To professionalise the public service, we propose

that:

oO An administrative head of the public service
should be created, with responsibility for
managing the career progression of heads of
department, including convening panels for
recruitment, performance assessment and
disciplinary procedures.

° A hybrid system for appointing heads of
departments should be introduced,
incorporating both political and administra-
tive elements.

oO A graduate recruitment programme and a
local government. skills development
strategy should be introduced to attract high-
quality candidates.

oO The role of the Public Service Commission in
championing norms and standards, and
monitoring recruitment processes should be
strengthened.

oO A purely administrative approach should be
adopted for lower-level appointments, with
senior officials given full authority to appoint

staff in their departments.

The skills profile of the public service mirrors the
national skills profile. There are critical shortages of

good-quality doctors, engineers, information

 

technology professionals, forensic specialists,
detectives, planners, accountants, prosecutors,
curriculum advisors and so on. In addition, the
management ability of senior staff operating in a
complex organisational, political and social context
requires greater attention. To solve both the
technical and managerial skills shortages, govern-

ment has to take a long-term perspective on

 

developing the skills it needs through career-
pathing, mentoring, and closer partnerships with

universities and schools of management.

Accountability is essential to democracy. There are
several weaknesses in the accountability chain, with
a general culture of blame-shifting. The account-
ability chain has to be strengthened from top to
bottom. To begin with, parliamentary accountability
is weak, with Parliament failing to fulfil its most basic
oversight role. Education outcomes cannot im-
prove unless accountability is reinforced through-
out the system, from learner results to the delivery
of text books. The rising number of service delivery
protests indicates that the state also needs to make it
easier for citizens to raise concerns. When entering
a public building, citizens should be able to see what
service they can expect, and where to go and who

to talk to if they are not satisfied.

Accountability in state-owned enterprises has been
blurred through a complex, unclear appointment
process and, at times, undue political interference.
We recommend clarifying lines of accountability by
developing public-interest mandates that set out
how each state-owned enterprise serves the public
interest, ensuring appointment processes are
meritocratic and transparent, and improving
coordination between the policy and shareholder

departments.

Improvements have been achieved in the efficiency
of service delivery in pockets of government,
notably the South African Revenue Service and pilot
projects in the Departments of Home Affairs,
Health and Justice. Operations management and
system improvements have been at the heart of
these reforms, and these successes need to be
replicated in more areas of government. These
experiences show what can be achieved when
leaders and staff are committed to working together

to improve performance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

45
 46

 

The efficacy of the intergovernmental system is a
hotly debated subject. The different spheres of gov-
ernment are interdependent and we need to find
ways of ensuring they work together more effec-
tively. The plan proposes a change of approach away
from trying to find new structural arrangements,
which is destabilising, towards identifying and
resolving specific weaknesses in coordination and
capacity. The state needs to improve its management
of the system, including mediating agreements
between district and local municipalities where there
is duplication or conflict over the allocation of
responsibilities and resources. Provinces should
focus on their core functions and develop their

capacity to support and oversee local government.

The constitutional framework allows for more
differentiation in the allocation of powers and
functions, and this should be used to ensure a better
fit between the capacity and responsibilities of
provinces and municipalities. The existing system
can be improved, with clarification of responsibili-
ties in the areas of housing, water, sanitation,
electricity and public transport. Large cities should
be given greater fiscal and political powers to
coordinate human settlement upgrading, transport
and spatial planning. In other areas, regional utilities
could provide services on behalf of less well
resourced municipalities, but this must be led by
municipalities to avoid undermining democratic

accountability for service delivery.

Fighting corruption

High corruption levels frustrate society’s ability to
operate fairly and efficiently, and the state's ability to
deliver on its development mandate. According to
Transparency International's global corruption
survey, between 2001 and 2010, the level of
corruption increased. Corruption often involves
both public- and private-sector participants. The
perception of high levels of malfeasance at senior
levels of government makes the fight against

corruption that much harder.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

Strong social factors play a contributing role.
Perceptions that the structure of the economy is
unjust, historical inequities and new forms of
empowerment that have benefited politically
connected individuals fuel a culture in which
corruption thrives, both in government and in
business. These underlying social phenomena must

be addressed as part of the fight against corruption.

Political will is essential to combat this scourge.
Political will is measured by assessing the amount of
money spent fighting corruption, the legal arsenal
that corruption-busting institutions have at their
disposal, the independence of anti-corruption
authorities from political interference and the
consistency with which the law is applied. Being soft
on smaller cases, or unusually tough on corruption

involving political opponents, implies inconsistency.

In addition to political will, corruption has to be
fought on three fronts: deterrence, prevention and
education. Deterrence helps people understand
that they are likely to get caught and punished.
Prevention is about systems (information, audit and
so on) that make it hard to engage in corrupt acts.

The social dimensions of corruption need to be

tackled by focusing on values, through education.

 
 We propose several measures to strengthen South

Africa's anti-corruption arsenal:

° Competent, skilled institutions like the Public

Protector and Special Investigating Unit need
to be adequately funded and staffed and free
from external interference.
While thousands of cases are investigated,
few get to court. Specialised teams of
prosecutors and special courts should be
established.

° Government's procurement policies blur
the line in matters of corruption, and the
state procurement system has become
overly bureaucratised. The emphasis on
compliance by box-ticking makes the system
costly, burdensome, ineffective and prone to
fraud. We propose greater central oversight
over large and long-term tenders, making it
illegal for public servants to operate certain
types of businesses and making individuals
liable for losses in proven cases of corrup-
tion.

© The country has barely begun to tackle
societal factors that contribute to corruption.
South Africa’s history of state-sponsored
patronage further blurs ethical standards.
International experience shows that with
political will and sustained application of the
right strategies, corruption can be signifi-

cantly reduced and publictrust restored.

Leadership and responsibility

throughout society

The successful implementation of this plan requires
strong leadership from government, business,

labour and civil society.

South Africa needs leaders throughout society to
work together. Just as the transition from apartheid
was a win-win solution rather than a short-sighted
power struggle, the fight against poverty and

inequality will have benefits for all — black and white,

 

rich and poor. Given the country’s divided past,
leaders sometimes advocate positions that serve
narrow, short-term interests at the expense of a
broader, long-term agenda. It is essential to break
out of this cycle, with leaders that are willing and
able to take on greater responsibility to address

South Africa's challenges.

‘To successfully implement this plan, the country
needs partnerships across society working together
towards a common purpose. At present, South
Africa has high levels of mistrust between major social
partners. A virtuous cycle of building trust and engag-
ing in discussion to confront the most pressing chal-

lenges is needed — one that takes a long term view.

The government will be responsible for a large
share of the recommendations in the plan. To
implement these recommendations, it will need to
strengthen its accountability chain, improve its
capacity, be prepared to make difficult decisions and
work with others in society to solve challenges. This
means communicating honestly and sincerely with
the public, while holding citizens accountable for
their actions. Leaders, especially in government,
must also face up to difficult decisions and trade-offs.
Strong leadership is about making such decisions
and effectively persuading society that the best path

is being pursued.

The state sets the ethical bar for society as a whole.
If corruption is seen as acceptable in government, it
will affect the way society conducts itself. This makes
it even more important that government acts to

address the high levels of corruption in its ranks.

The private sector employs about three-quarters of
South Africa's workers and accounts for over two-
thirds of investment and R&D expenditure. South
Africa needs a thriving private sector that is investing
in productive capacity. While the profit motive

drives business, companies cannot grow unless

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

47
 48

 

they operate in an environment where employ-
ment and income levels are rising. Legislation
requires business to consider employment equity,
black economic empowerment, the environment,
skills development, local content, small-business
development, community social responsibility and
several location-specific imperatives, such as mining
area development strategies. In this complex
context, it is in the long-term interests of all
businesses for the country to grow faster and for

more people to be employed.

It is also in the interests of business that the level of
inequality be reduced. Inequality raises the cost of
doing business, skews market structure and
ultimately limits growth opportunities. It also breeds
mistrust and tension. Excessive
executive remuneration does
little to build a more inclusive
society where everyone feels that
they share in the fruits of
development. While legislating
salaries is impractical, leadership is
required to ensure that busi-

nesses act more responsibly.

Despite healthy balance sheets,

many South African corporations are not investing
because the global economy remains weak.
Businesses are also concerned about changes in the
policy and regulatory environment that may raise
costs. To some extent, low investment is also the
result of inadequate infrastructure provided by
state-owned enterprises. South Africa needs to
break this cycle of low growth and low investment.
Government has an important role to play in
building trust and confidence to encourage long-
term investment. Business also has a role to play — if
everyone invests more, the economic gains will

accrue to the private sector.

South Africa has a well-developed and vibrant

trade-union movement. Historically, trade unions

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

 

 

have played a role in politics, understanding that the
issues pertinent to its members do not stop at the
factory gate. Unions advance the interests of their
members and give voice to vulnerable workers,
such as farm workers, domestic workers or casual
workers. The rights and benefits afforded to
workers and increases in living standards that most
workers have seen since 1994 constitute a

significant gain for the country.

To continue to make progress in raising incomes
and living standards, productivity must also
increase. South Africa’s labour market is often
characterised by contestation between profitable
firms and reasonably well-paid employees.
Outcomes determined in bargaining processes
leave little room for new entrants
to enter the workplace. To
address high levels of unemploy-
ment, particularly among youth,
extraordinary measures will be
required. Union leadership is
critical to ensuring that gains by
members are sustainable in the
long term. To achieve this,
productivity and employment

have to rise continuously.

In a developmental state, unions share responsibil-
ity for the quality of services delivered, for improv-
ing the performance of government, and for fighting

corruption and inefficiency.

Civil society leaders represent citizens on issues
closest to their hearts and must be taken seriously.
These leaders are responsible for ensuring that that
criticism and protest are conducted with dignity and
maturity. Although civil society leaders sometimes
only represent narrow interests in a broad and
diverse society, they form an integral part of a
vibrant democracy that involves people in their own

development.
 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

FOR THE PLAN

The role of the National Planning Commission is to
advise government and the country on issues
affecting the country’s long-term development.
This is a plan for the entire country, and all sections
of society need to take responsibility for making it a
reality. To successfully implement the plan, the
Commission identifies a series of critical success

factors.

Focused leadership

Because the plan is designed to bring about
fundamental change over a period of nearly two
decades, it requires a degree of policy consistency
that straddles changes in leadership in government,
business and labour. Many aspects of the plan will
require years of effort to deliver results. For
example, the transition to a low-carbon economy
will need long-term policies and spatial planning
regulations will take decades to overcome the
geographic divisions of apartheid. Policy changes
should be approached cautiously based on
experience and evidence so that the country does

notlose sight of its long-term objectives.

Aplan for all
Broad support across society is needed for the
successful implementation of the plan. In a
vibrant democracy this support will not be

uncritical. Vigorous debate is essential for
building consensus and
broad-based ownership
of the plan.
Constructive debate also
contributes to nation
building by enabling
South Africans to

develop a better
understanding

and to take

ownership of

 

 
  
   
  
 
   
  
  
  
  

priorities. Different parts of the plan require buy-in
and sacrifice from different sectors. When differ-
ences occur, it is important that the reasons for
disagreement are debated and clearly explained, so
that there can be broad consensus on the way
forward. The National Planning Commission can
use its convening power to bring stakeholders
together to facilitate dialogue and develop

solutions.

Institutional capability

Much of the plan deals with the institutional reforms
required to overcome weaknesses in the public
sector, particularly where public agencies are
unable to meet their responsibilities to poor
communities. These proposals are about develop-
ing the attributes necessary to support the plan.
Building institutional capability takes time and effort.
The chapter on building a capable and develop-
mental state provides pointers on the approach to
be pursued. Institutions improve through continu-
ous learning and incremental steps; tackling the
most serious problem, resolving it and moving to
the next priority. This requires good management,
acommitment to high performance, an uncompro-
mising focus on ethics and a willingness to learn

from experience.

Several challenges require attention, including a
critical shortage of skills, a complex intergovern-
mental system, high levels of corruption, weak
lines of accountability, inadequate legislative
oversight and a long history
of blurring the lines
between party and state.
These are difficult issues,
requiring honest
reflection, careful
planning and decisive

leadership.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 
  

    
   

Resource mobilisation and agreement

on trade-offs

The National Development Plan will shape
resource allocations over the next two decades, but
it will not determine annual budgets. The best way
to generate resources to implement the plan is to
grow the economy faster. Ifthe economy grows by
more than 5 percent a year, government revenue
and the profits of private firms will more than

double over the next 20 years.

The plan supports government's intention to
gradually shift state resources towards investments
that reshape the economy, broaden opportunities
and enhance capabilities. As a result, other parts of

the national budget will need to grow more slowly.

Spending more on investment is only the first step.
South Africa also has to improve the quality of this
spending through better planning, sound procure-
ment systems and greater competition in the econ-
omy. There is a need for greater efficiency in all areas
of government expenditure, because the overall
envelope is likely to grow relatively slowly over the
medium term. Particular attention needs to be given
to managing the government wage bill, making
resources available for other priorities. This will
involve balancing competing pressures such as
increasing staff numbers, adequately remunerating

skilled professionals and improving benefit coverage.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN - 2030

 

The plan proposes a three-pronged human-
resources strategy involving a long-term training
strategy, better outputs from the higher-education

sector and strategic allocation of scarce resources.

Sequencing and willingness to prioritise

Government has to be willing to prioritise. Cabinet
and senior public officials should focus most of their
attention on a few strategic priorities. This plan
provides such a strategic framework. It identifies
high-level priorities and, in some areas, a specific
sequencing. For example, it highlights the need to
raise the quality of FET colleges before rapidly
expanding capacity. Implementing this plan will
require some tough, potentially unpopular

decisions.

Clarity on responsibility

Arecurring theme in the plan is that the accountabil-
ity chain needs to be tightened. The public needs a
clearer sense of who is accountable for what. There
need to be systems to hold all leaders in society

accountable for their conduct.

Weak, poorly performing systems make it hard to
attribute responsibility, with the frequent result that
no one is accountable. The plan cites the example
of what happens when the water in a town is found
to be undrinkable. The media blame the Minister of
Water Affairs. The community

blames the mayor. The
mayor blames the head

of the water utility. The
head of the water utility
blames the technical
engineer. The engineer says
that the maintenance budget has been

cut for the past three years and now the
water is undrinkable. The head of finance in
the municipality says that the budget was
cut because personnel costs have

crowded out maintenance expendi-
 ture. The mayor argues that the salary structure is
negotiated at a national level by the South African
Local Government Association. The association
says that municipalities can opt out of these

agreements ifthey are unaffordable. And so on.

South Africa's intergovernmental system is
complex, but this challenge is not an excuse for
blurring lines of responsibility. The establishment of
the Department of Performance Monitoring and
Evaluation is a positive step to tighten the account-
ability chain. The Commission also calls for
shareholder compacts with state-owned enter-
prises and performance agreements with Cabinet

ministers to be made public.

It needs to be clear when parties outside govern-
ment are responsible for implementing parts of the
plan. Business, labour and civil society are diverse
groupings and rarely speak with a common voice.
evertheless, clear responsibilities and account-
ability chains, including with social partners, are
essential for the success of the plan. In many areas,
business, labour and civil society can identify how
hey can contribute to the plan's priorities.

However, in some cases this role will need to be

 

formalised. Working together to realise particular
objectives in the plan will help to build trust both

within and between sectors.

CONCLUSION

To make meaningful,
rapid and sustained

progress in reducing
poverty and inequality over
the next two decades, South
Africa needs to fix the future, starting
today. This plan outlines a new
development approach that seeks to
involve communities, youth,

workers, the unemployed and

business in partnership with a

 

  

capable state. The aim is to develop the capabilities
of individuals and of the country, creating opportu-
nities for all. Critically, the plan emphasises the
urgent need to make faster progress on several

fronts to sustainably reduce poverty and inequality.

The National Development Plan is based on
extensive research, consultation and engagement.
While it is neither perfect nor complete, it sets out
firm proposals to solve the country's problems, and
to deepen the engagement of South Africans from

all walks of life in building our future.

The country we seek to build by 2030 is just, fair,
prosperous and equitable. Most of all, it is a country
that each and every South African can proudly call
home. It is up to all South Africans to play a role in

fixing the future.
