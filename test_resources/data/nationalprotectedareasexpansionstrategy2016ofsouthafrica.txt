Executive summary
The National Protected Area Expansion 
Strategy, first published in 2008 (NPAES 
2008)1
, presents a 20-year strategy for the 
expansion of protected areas in South Africa. 
Provision is made for the review and updating 
of the NPAES every 5 years. This document 
(NPAES 2016) represents the first full revision 
of the NPAES 2008, and the updated strategy 
for the next 5-years (2016 – 2020). Each new 
revision of the NPAES refers to a rolling 20-
year period, so this revision sets out a future 
20-year strategy. 
The updated NPAES 2016 now includes: 
 New biodiversity data and newly declared 
protected areas as well as updated 
provincial conservation plans and 
provincial protected area expansion 
strategies (PAES), to improve the setting 
of targets and the identification of priority 
areas for meeting these targets. 
 A review of the performance of protected 
area institutions in protected area 
expansion for the first implementation 
phase of the NPAES (2008 – 2014)2
. 
 A description of the priority activities, 
with explicit performance targets, for the 
second implementation phase (2016 –
2020) of the NPAES. 
In order to maintain continuity of the NPAES 
over the 20 years of the strategy, the 
structure of this document has been 
maintained using similar formatting to the 
NPAES 2008. The document has similar 
sections, but the information has been revised 
and updated.

Why a National Protected Area 
Expansion Strategy? 
South Africa’s protected area network 
currently falls far short of representing all 
ecosystems and maintaining ecological 
processes. In this context, the goal of the 
National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 
(NPAES) is to achieve cost effective protected 
area expansion for improved ecosystem 
representation, ecological sustainability and 
resilience to climate change. The NPAES 
highlights how we can become more efficient 
and effective in allocating the scarce human 
and financial resources available for protected 
area expansion. It sets protected area targets, 
maps priority areas for protected area 
expansion, and makes recommendations on 
mechanisms to achieve this. The common set 
of targets and spatial priorities provided by 
the NPAES enable co-ordination between the 
many role players involved in protected area 
expansion. 
The role of protected areas 
initiating the review process mean that this review 
now covers the period 2008 to 2014. 
The goal of the NPAES is to achieve cost 
effective protected area expansion for 
improved ecosystem representation, 
ecological sustainability and resilience to 
climate change. It sets protected area 
targets, maps priority areas for protected 
area expansion, and makes 
recommendations on mechanisms to 
achieve this.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 viii 
Protected areas are areas of land or sea that 
are protected by law and managed mainly for 
biodiversity conservation. Protected areas 
recognised in the National Environmental 
Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 
2003) are considered protected areas in the 
NPAES. The Protected Areas Act provides for 
several categories of protected areas, 
including special nature reserves, national 
parks, nature reserves, marine protected 
areas and protected environments. 
Protected areas are vital for ecological 
sustainability and climate change adaptation. 
They also serve as nodes in our ecological 
infrastructure network, protecting the 
ecosystems that deliver important ecosystem 
services to people. This natural infrastructure 
is largely free, so is often unnoticed or underappreciated, but it is just as important for 
underpinning human livelihoods and wellbeing as our extensive built infrastructure 
network and our social infrastructure. South 
Africa has a unique opportunity to take a 
global lead in giving protected areas a central 
role in our climate change response strategy. 
To achieve this, the biases of the current 
protected area network are being addressed 
to ensure more effective inclusion of underrepresented terrestrial ecosystems, river 
ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries and marine 
ecosystems in the national protected area 
estate. 
Through the protection and management that 
protected areas provide for priority 
ecosystems and catchments, they help to 
secure the provision of important ecosystem 
services, such as production of clean water, 
flood moderation, prevention of erosion, 
carbon storage, and the aesthetic value of the 
landscape. Marine protected areas can play a 
particularly important role in keeping our 
fisheries sustainable, for example by 
protecting nursery grounds for commercially 
important fish species. In this way, protected 
areas form a valuable network of ecological 
infrastructure. 
Protected areas can support rural livelihoods 
and local economic development. Especially in 
marginal agricultural areas, conservationrelated industries have higher economic 
potential than agricultural activities such as 
stock farming. 
The relationship between protected areas and 
land reform has tended to be a controversial 
issue, with the focus usually on land claims in 
existing protected areas. Less attention has 
been paid to the opportunities for protected 
area expansion to actively support the land 
reform agenda and the diversification of rural 
livelihood options, especially in agriculturally 
marginal areas. Scope exists for protected 
area expansion to work in partnership with 
land reform for mutual benefit, for example 
through contract agreements that establish 
nature reserves or other forms of biodiversity 
stewardship agreement. In such cases, the 
land remains in the hands of its owners rather 
than being transferred to a protected area

agency. The opportunity exists for local 
communities, as potentially major landholders 
through the land reform process, to have full 
access to the economic opportunities 
associated with ecotourism. 
Protected areas are a powerful tool for 
biodiversity conservation and climate change 
adaptation, but not the only one. The National 
Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act 
(Act 10 of 2004) gives us a suite of legal tools, 
such as publishing bioregional plans and 
listing threatened ecosystems, for conserving 
the many biodiversity priority areas that lie 
outside the protected area network. These 
tools complement the expansion and effective 
management of the protected area network 
in pursuit of the overall goals of biodiversity 
conservation and sustainable development. 
Protected area targets 
Protected area targets are action targets that 
indicate how much of each ecosystem should 
be included in protected areas. Targets help 
to focus protected area expansion on the 
least protected ecosystems, and provide the 
basis for assessments of protection level and 
progress towards a more representative 
protected area network. The NPAES uses the 
established biodiversity targets for each 
ecosystem from the National Biodiversity 
Assessment (NBA)3
 as the long-term 
protected area targets. This ensures that 
targets are scientifically robust and have an 
ecological basis, such that no further 
ecosystems become Critically Endangered, 
 
3
 Driver et al., 2012. 
and that targets and assessment results for 
the NBA and the NPAES align. The 20-year 
targets for protected area expansion were 
determined by proportionally allocating the 
total area committed to under the Convention 
on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi biodiversity 
targets to the individual ecosystems based on 
their long-term targets. The targets are set for 
individual ecosystem types. 
The major improvements of this revised 
NPAES 2016 are that in addition to targets for 
terrestrial vegetation types and broad marine 
systems, comprehensive targets have now 
been set for wetlands, rivers, estuaries, 
specific marine ecosystems, as well as for the 
terrestrial and marine ecosystems of our 
Southern Oceans and Sub-Antarctic 
territories. These targets were set based on a 
new integrated ecosystem map. 
Targets can only be met by secured intact 
habitat. This principle was established in the 
NPAES 2008 but was previously only partially 
implemented as only artificial waterbodies 
were excluded. In the NPAES 2016, we have 
excluded all poor condition habitats based on 
a new integrated ecosystem condition map. 
Targets are currently only evaluated in legally 
recognised protected areas. However, once 
other conservation areas are effectively 
secured, verified and monitored, they may 
also contribute to meeting targets. 
The approach taken in the NPAES is that clear 
principles and a repeatable method are

land reform agenda and the diversification 
of rural livelihoods.

established for target 
setting. This ensures 
easy updates and 
allows provinces and 
agencies to calculate 
compatible targets if 
they are utilising 
different or finer scale 
ecosystem maps. 
South Africa has 969 
distinct ecosystem 
types, across 26 
biozones4
. Of these, 
201 (21%) are Well 
Protected, 122 (13%) 
are Moderately Protected, 286 (30%) are 
Poorly Protected, and 360 (37%) are Not 
Protected5
. 
Protection level varies among regions and 
biozones. Well Protected ecosystems include 
the Southern Oceans and Sub-Antarctic 
territories. The protected area targets for 
these areas are now 
fully met. Also 
reasonably protected are coastal and other 
shallow water systems, although key gaps 
exist on the West Coast and there are too few 
no-take areas. The offshore benthic and 
pelagic ecosystems are almost completely 
unprotected, although this should soon 
change with the implementation of Operation 
Phakisa6
. Inland aquatic ecosystems (i.e. 
rivers, wetlands and estuaries) are extremely 
poorly represented in the current protected 
area network, and even many areas that are 
within reserves are in poor condition. Current 
protection of terrestrial ecosystems is still 
insufficient, though good coverage of Forest 
ecosystems has been achieved. Ecosystems of 
 
4
 Biozones are major habitat units. In the 
terrestrial environment, they are the same as 
biomes, but the term biozone is used so that 
equivalent river, wetland and marine habitat units 
can be included. 
the Nama-Karoo, Grasslands and Succulent 
Karoo are not well represented in the current 
protected area network, while lowland 
Fynbos and central Savanna ecosystems are 
also very under-represented. 
South Africa’s current protected area network 
thus falls far short of representing all 
ecosystems. To meet the long-term protected 
area targets we need to add 413 163km2
 to 
the protected area network, of which 
211 896km2 are marine benthic and coastal 
ecosystems. In addition to this, 212 140km2
 of 
marine pelagic ecosystems needs to be 
secured, though some of this could be 
achieved at the same time as benthic and 
coastal ecosystems as these systems overlap. 
To reach these long-term targets, 20-year 
targets have also been set. 255 877km2
 need 
to be added the protected area network over 
the next 20 years, of which 104 962km2
 are 
marine benthic and coastal ecosystems. Of

categories.

the 20 year total, 146 814km2
 is required for 
terrestrial ecosystems, 2 352km2
 for wetlands 
and 1 490km2
 for rivers. A separate 
104 780km2
 is required to meet marine 
pelagic targets though this may overlap with 
some of the area required to meet the 
benthic target.
Priority areas for protected area 
expansion 
Having set protected area targets, the next 
step is to determine which geographic areas 
are the highest priorities for protected area 
expansion to meet those targets. 
The NPAES takes the approach that the 
national role is not to undertake the spatial 
planning, but rather to set targets, identify 
key underlying planning principles, collate the 
provincial and sector priorities, and identify 
any remaining gaps. The previous NPAES 2008 
was forced to establish the spatial priorities 
nationally as few provinces or agencies had 
conservation plans and even fewer had 
specific sets of protected area expansion 
priorities. This has changed sufficiently to 
allow a set of priority areas to be built-up 
from provincial and agency plans. This is an 
improvement, as detailed planning, 
scheduling and operational issues are all best 
dealt with at the provincial and agency level. 
The revised NPAES 2016 identifies additional 
priorities only where these do not exist, and 
also highlights ecosystems where, if fully 
Figure 2: Priority areas for protected area expansion in South Africa.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 xii 
implemented, the current set of priorities will 
not achieve targets. Provinces and agencies 
are likely to refine, revise and adapt their 
systematic spatial plans and protected area 
expansion priorities over time. For this 
reason, the NPAES highlights some overall 
principles that should be applied in protected 
area expansion planning and implementation. 
The requirement for a systematic, targetdriven approach that is well integrated across 
ecosystems and between organisations is 
emphasised. 
A comprehensive set of priority areas was 
compiled based on the priorities identified by 
provincial and other agencies in their 
protected area expansion strategies. The 
NPAES identified additional areas in the 
Northern Cape where there is a recently 
approved current protected area expansion 
strategy. The identified priority areas cover a 
total area of 190 109km2
, in addition to areas 
currently under negotiation covering 73 
610km2
 of mostly marine areas. 
Overall, the set of priorities is well aligned 
with requirements for improving the 
representation of most ecosystems over the 
next 20 years. The number of Well Protected 
ecosystems is anticipated to more than 
double, while Not Protected ecosystems will 
reduce by around 70%. An improvement in 
coverage is anticipated for 665 ecosystem 
types, with greatest progress likely in the 
Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna, 
wetlands, rivers and offshore benthic and 
pelagic ecosystems. 
However, even if the priorities were to be 
implemented, no improvement in protection 
level is expected for 87 ecosystem types. The 
main areas with ecosystems where no 
improvement is anticipated are in the Nama 
Karoo and arid Savanna biozones. 
Mechanisms for protected area 
expansion 
There are three main mechanisms for 
expanding the land-based protected area 
network: 
 Acquisition of land, the traditional way of 
establishing and expanding protected 
areas, which involves large upfront costs. 
 Contract agreements are agreements in 
which landowners maintain ownership of 
their land but enter into a contract with a 
protected area agency in return for 
protected area status. Provisions in the 
Protected Areas Act facilitate these 
agreements. Contract agreements are 
attractive because they tend to cost 
protected area agencies less than 
acquisition, and because by far the largest 
proportion of land in the priority areas for 
protected area expansion lies in private 
hands. Biodiversity stewardship 
programmes should be strengthened so 
that more use can be made of contract 
agreements in the expansion of the 
protected area network. There are 
significant potential synergies between 
biodiversity stewardship programmes, 
land reform and rural development. 
 Declaration of public or state land
involves reassigning land to a protected 
area agency from another organ of state. 
It has limited applicability because only a 
small proportion of land in the priority 
Contract agreements are a key mechanism 
for expanding the protected area network. 
They are often much more cost effective 
than acquisition of land, and are used 
increasingly as part of biodiversity 
stewardship programmes.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 xiii 
areas for protected area expansion is 
public land. 
Each one of these mechanisms has an 
important role to play, with contract 
agreements being used increasingly as part of 
biodiversity stewardship programmes. 
Mechanisms for expanding the marine 
protected area network are more complex 
and require significant political negotiation 
processes and the accommodation of 
conflicting marine activities. Marine spatial 
planning processes and subsequent 
incorporation of agreed areas into marine 
protected areas nevertheless have potential 
to rapidly improve the representation of 
marine ecosystems when the process is 
successfully undertaken. South Africa’s 
Operation Phakisa is proving to be 
international best practice in this regard. 
Mechanisms for securing protected areas 
specifically focused on inland aquatic 
ecosystems remain poorly understood. The 
current process of securing rivers, wetlands 
and estuaries using the methods used for 
terrestrial ecosystems has proved largely 
ineffective. Even when the features are fully 
incorporated into protected areas, they are 
still subject to catchment related impacts. 
Much work remains to understand how to 
properly secure inland aquatic ecosystems 
and their associated processes.
Implementation of the NPAES 
The primary implementers of the NPAES are 
protected area agencies and institutions. 
These include provincial conservation 
authorities; South African National Parks 
(SANParks); the Department of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); and the Oceans 
and Coasts Branch of the Department of 
Environmental Affairs (DEA). Although most 
agencies have developed institution-specific 
protected area expansion plans, those that 
have not need to rapidly do so. Existing plans 
will require revision and greater alignment 
with the national strategy, which has been 
revised for the second phase of the NPAES. 
DEA (through Working Group 1 of MINMEC) 
will ensure alignment of the efforts of the 
multiple agencies involved in protected area 
expansion. It will also provide a forum for 
discussing challenges and sharing lessons, and 
track progress towards meeting protected 
area targets. Establishing and strengthening 
provincial biodiversity stewardship 
programmes is an institutional priority for 
provincial conservation authorities and for 
DEA. 
The NPAES 2016 provides a revised set of 
implementation targets for phase 2 (2016 –
2020), developed with consideration of the 
realistic resources available to implementing 
agencies. 
Financing protected area expansion 
Protected area expansion draws on several 
sources of finance, all of which have an 
important role to play given the size of the 
task of achieving protected area targets. 
These sources include funding from National 
Treasury and donors (particularly for land 
acquisition); revenues earned from protected 
areas; biodiversity-related fiscal reform to 
facilitate investment and expenditure by National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 xiv 
private landowners through contract 
agreements; and strategic implementation of 
the biodiversity offsets programme. 
The purchase of land for protected area 
expansion could arguably be a good national 
investment in climate change adaptation, but 
in reality, the cost is prohibitive for protected 
area agencies. For this reason, this strategy 
highlights the importance of expansion 
mechanisms other than land acquisition, 
particularly contract agreements through the 
biodiversity stewardship programmes. 
Fiscal incentives contained in the Revenue 
Laws Amendment Act (Act 60 of 2008), have 
the potential to stimulate protected area 
expansion by making defined conservation 
management costs and land costs tax 
deductible for landowners who have entered 
into specified contractual agreements. 
Additional biodiversity-related fiscal reform 
options being explored include reducing the 
transaction costs associated with land 
acquisition for protected areas, removing 
perverse incentives in municipal property 
rates, and using Expanded Public Works 
Programme funding as an incentive to 
encourage landowners to enter into contract 
agreements. 
The strategic and efficient use of biodiversity 
offsets could potentially support the 
expansion of the protected area network. 
Priority areas for protected area expansion 
should be the major receiving sites for offsets, 
rather than ad hoc and individually identified 
sites. Careful planning will be necessary to 
ensure that offsets contribute optimally to 
protected area expansion and management, 
and do not place an undue burden on 
protected area agencies. A key issue is 
securing ongoing management costs. 
Innovative financial mechanisms for protected 
area expansion that could be piloted include a 
conservation trust fund, and payments for 
ecosystem services in cases where protected 
areas contribute to, for example, catchment 
management and water supply. 
Information gaps and research 
priorities 
A number of information gaps identified in 
the first phase of the NPAES were filled in this 
revision. There remain further gaps that 
should be addressed in future revisions of the 
NPAES. These include an accurate and up-todate mapping of protected areas and a 
national spatial data layer on land ownership 
and tenure. 
Research priorities include further exploration 
of the role of protected areas in supporting 
ecosystem-based adaptation to climate 
change. Ecologically meaningful biodiversity 
targets for aquatic ecosystems need to be 
developed. Exploration of innovative ways to 
consider land price and opportunity costs in 
the identification of priority areas for 
protected area expansion are needed, as well 
as investigation of the likely costs of different 
mechanisms for protected area expansion 
into the future. Also useful would be 
additional research into the relative income 
and job creation potential of agriculture 
compared with protected areas and 
ecotourism. Finally, pilot projects are needed 
to evaluate the ways in which biodiversity 
stewardship agreements can used to support 
land reform and rural development. 
The strategic and efficient use of 
biodiversity offsets could potentially 
support the expansion of the protected 
area network. Priority areas for protected 
area expansion should be the major 
receiving sites for offsets.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 1 
1. Why a National Protected Area Expansion Strategy?
The goal of the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy (NPAES) is to achieve cost effective 
protected area expansion for improved ecosystem representation, ecological sustainability and 
resilience to climate change. It sets protected area targets, maps priority areas for protected area 
expansion, and makes recommendations on mechanisms to achieve this. This is particularly 
important in the context of South Africa’s globally exceptional biodiversity richness on the one hand, 
and significant financial and human resource constraints on the other.
The NPAES is a 20-year strategy with 5-year implementation targets aligned with a 5-year revision 
cycle. Each new revision of the NPAES refers to a rolling 20-year period, so this revision sets out a 
future 20-year strategy. The NPAES 2016 reviews the first phase of the NPAES (2008 – 2014) and 
provides the strategy and implementation plan for the second phase (2016 – 2020).
This chapter outlines the importance of the NPAES in enabling co-ordination among many roleplayers towards more efficiently and effectively allocating the limited resources available for 
protected area expansion. It also sets out the scope of the NPAES and the structure of this strategy.
South Africa’s protected area network 
remains insufficient to conserve biodiversity 
and ecological processes effectively, or to play 
its full potential role in providing resilience to 
the impacts of climate change. This is because 
of the ad hoc way the protected area network 
has developed over time, protecting some 
ecosystems well and others hardly at all. 
Historically, freshwater, estuarine and 
offshore marine ecosystems were especially 
poorly represented in the protected area 
network although significant steps have been 
taken recently to improve this situation.
The overall goal of the NPAES is to achieve 
cost effective protected area expansion for 
improved ecosystem representation, 
ecological sustainability and climate change 
adaptation. The NPAES highlights how we can 
become more efficient and effective in 
allocating limited resources available for 
protected area expansion. It sets protected 
area targets, maps priority areas for protected 
area expansion, and makes recommendations 
on mechanisms to achieve this. 
While the primary roles of the protected area 
network are representation of all ecosystems, 
ecological sustainability and climate change 
resilience, protected areas also deliver 
significant socio-economic benefits, especially 
in rural areas, thus contributing to South 
Africa’s overall development goals.
Many role players, public and private, are 
involved in creating, expanding and managing 
protected areas in South Africa. The NPAES 
provides a common set of targets and spatial 
priorities to guide efforts and enable coordination. This is particularly important in 
the context of South Africa’s globally 
exceptional biodiversity richness on the one 
hand, and significant financial and human 
resource constraints on the other. 
South Africa’s current protected area 
network in both the terrestrial and the 
marine environments remains insufficient 
to conserve biodiversity and ecological 
processes effectively, or to play its full 
potential role in providing resilience to the 
impacts of climate change.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 2 
The Department of Environmental Affairs 
(DEA) led the development of the NPAES, in 
consultation with the protected area agencies 
and other key stakeholders. The need for the 
development of the NPAES was established in 
the National Biodiversity Framework7
. The 
NPAES is a 20-year strategy with 5-year 
implementation targets aligned with a 5-year 
revision cycle. Each new revision of the NPAES 
refers to a rolling 20-year period. The NPAES 
2016 covers the implementation period 2016-
2020 and sets out a future 20-year strategy. 
The NPAES does not deal with site-scale 
planning or exactly which sites should be 
included in the protected area network, nor 
does it deal with detailed implementation 
planning for expanding protected areas. All of 
these are most appropriately done by 
protected area agencies and institutions, 
using the NPAES as a guide. 
Expansion of the protected area network 
should take place concurrently with efforts to 
improve biodiversity management 
effectiveness within existing and new 
protected areas. This need is not addressed in 
the NPAES, but requires attention alongside 
the implementation of the NPAES, particularly 
in some provincial protected area agencies as 
well as in the marine protected areas.

The NPAES is intended to be used by all those 
who play, or could play, a role in protected 
area expansion, including protected area 
institutions, agencies and managers, 
conservation non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) and funding agencies, policymakers in 
relevant national departments, municipalities 
and the private sector.

2. The role of protected areas
Protected areas are vital for ecological sustainability and climate change adaptation, serving as 
nodes in our ecological infrastructure network. South Africa has a strong legal context for protected 
areas and management of biodiversity. This chapter explains the role of protected areas in 
biodiversity conservation and ecological sustainability, in addition to the role they play in climate 
change adaptation, land reform and rural livelihoods, and socio-economic development. South 
Africa has an opportunity to be proactive in giving protected areas a central role in our climate 
change response strategy. To achieve this, the biases of the current protected area network are 
being addressed to ensure more effective inclusion of under-represented terrestrial ecosystems, 
river ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries and marine ecosystems in the national protected area estate.
Protected areas are vital nodes in South 
Africa’s ecological infrastructure. Our 
ecological infrastructure consists of nodes and 
corridors of natural habitat that provide a 
range of ecosystem services as well as 
resilience to the impacts of climate change 
and natural disasters. This natural 
infrastructure is largely free, so is often 
unnoticed or under-appreciated, but it is just 
as important for underpinning human 
livelihoods and wellbeing as our extensive 
built infrastructure network and our social 
infrastructure. 
In this chapter, we highlight four of the most 
important contributions of protected areas, 
some of them only partially realised and all 
worthy of further attention: 
 Biodiversity conservation and ecological 
sustainability 
 Climate change adaptation 
 Land reform and rural livelihoods 
 Socio-economic development, including 
ecosystem services 
Transfrontier conservation areas, of which 
there are six shared between South Africa and 
our neighbouring countries, provide 
opportunities for scaling up all of the above 
contributions of protected areas and for 
strengthening the links between ecological 
sustainability benefits and socio-economic 
benefits. 
What are protected areas? 
Protected areas are areas of land or sea that 
are formally protected by law and managed 
mainly for biodiversity conservation. Only 
protected areas recognised in the National 
Environmental Management: Protected Areas 
Act (Act 57 of 2003) are considered to be 
protected areas in the NPAES. 
The Protected Areas Act distinguishes 
between several categories of protected area: 
special nature reserves, national parks, nature 
reserves, marine protected areas and 
protected environments. In addition, it also 
recognises world heritage sites, specially 
protected forest areas, and mountain 
catchment areas. 
The NPAES uses a narrower definition of 
protected areas than the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD) and IUCN, which 
acknowledge the role of other effective areaProtected areas are vital nodes in South 
Africa’s ecological infrastructure. They help 
to ensure functional landscapes that 
provide stable environments for the benefit 
of human well-being.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 4 
based conservation measures in protecting 
biodiversity. These areas could include 
conservation areas that are areas of land not 
formally protected by law but informally 
protected by the current owners and users 
and managed at least partly for biodiversity 
conservation. They can also include a range of 
other mechanisms such as the intact and 
conservation zoned areas of UNESCO 
biospheres, buffers zones on world heritage 
sites, areas protected by spatial planning laws 
(e.g. zoning for conservation use), areas 
protected by conservation servitudes, and in 
the marine context may include specially 
zoned fishery management areas. 
In the absence of legally binding measures 
that require effective management, these 
other area-based conservation measures may 
not provide sufficient protection. For this 
reason, the NPAES currently only evaluates 
protected areas. However, once other areabased conservation sites have been effectively 
secured (through legal measures other than 
the Protected Areas Act), are effectively 
managed, verified and monitored, then it is 
anticipated that intact conservation zoned 
areas under these other measures might also 
contribute to meeting targets. 
The legal context 
The Protected Areas Act is the central piece of 
legislation for the establishment and 
management of the protected area network 
in both the terrestrial and the marine 
environments. However, other legislation is 
also relevant, including the World Heritage 
Convention Act (Act 49 of 1999) for world 
heritage sites, the National Forests Act (Act 84 
of 1998) for protected forests, and the 
Mountain Catchment Areas Act (Act 63 of 
1970). In addition, several provinces have 
their own provincial legislation that deals with 
protected areas. 
Protected areas are a powerful tool for 
conserving biodiversity and adapting to 
climate change, but not the only one. There 
are also several other legislative tools relevant 
to the management of biodiversity in South 
Africa, the primary among them being the 
National Environmental Management: 
Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). The 
Biodiversity Act provides a suite of legal tools 
for conserving the many biodiversity priority 
areas that lie outside the protected area 
network and for various reasons are likely to 
remain outside of it. These tools include 
bioregional plans, biodiversity management 
plans, listing of threatened or protected 
ecosystems, listing of threatened or protected 
species, and regulations on alien and invasive 
species. In addition to regulatory tools 
provided by the Biodiversity Act, economic 
mechanisms such as environmental fiscal 
reform and payment for ecosystem services 
are currently being explored and developed in 
South Africa. 
The Marine Living Resources Act (Act 18 of 
1998) provides for additional mechanisms for 
biodiversity management over and above 
marine protected areas, and South Africa is in 
the process of implementing the ecosystem 
approach to fisheries management. 
This wide range of biodiversity management 
tools complements the expansion and 
effective management of the protected area 
network in pursuit of the overall goals of 
biodiversity conservation and sustainable 
development. 
The Protected Areas Act is the central piece 
of legislation for the establishment and 
management of the protected area 
network in both the terrestrial and marine 
environments.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 5 
Protected areas for biodiversity 
conservation and ecological 
sustainability 
Protected areas are the most secure and 
effective mechanism for conserving a 
representative sample of all biodiversity 
including all ecosystems and species. This is 
especially important in South Africa because 
of our globally exceptional levels of 
biodiversity. Conserving a viable 
representative sample of biodiversity 
contributes to ecological resilience and is one 
of the cornerstones of ecological 
sustainability. 
Historically, the protected area network has 
been biased towards some ecosystems, such 
as indigenous Forest, mountain Fynbos and 
lowveld Savanna, and has poorly covered 
other ecosystems such as Grasslands. Aquatic 
ecosystems, including rivers, wetlands, 
estuaries and offshore marine ecosystems, 
have been especially neglected. South Africa’s 
protected area network needs to include a 
representative sample of all ecosystems. How 
this can be achieved is discussed further in 
Chapter 4 on protected area targets. 
The long-term persistence of biodiversity 
depends not only on conserving a 
representative sample of biodiversity but also 
on maintaining a complex set of ecological 
processes, such as the functioning of river 
corridors and movement of species between 
uplands and lowlands. Ecological processes 
often occur across very large areas and over 
long periods of time, so they can be difficult 
to capture in the protected area network. 
Nevertheless, it is possible to take some 
ecological processes into account in the 
design of the protected area network.
For protected areas to achieve their full 
potential contribution to ecological 
sustainability, they need to include a 
representative sample of all ecosystems as 
well as key ecological processes. In 
recognition of this, the NPAES 2016 includes 
greater integration of the terrestrial and 
aquatic environments in the design 
calculations underpinning the spatial 
prioritisation of protected area expansion. 
This is especially important in South Africa 
where water scarcity means that freshwater 
ecosystems are under even greater pressure 
than terrestrial ecosystems. 
Estuaries can provide a focal point for 
integrating the design of terrestrial, 
freshwater and marine protected areas. 
Ideally, seamless integration is required 
between terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, 
inshore and offshore marine protected areas, 
to maximise the ecological sustainability 
benefits of protected areas.
For protected areas to achieve their full 
potential contribution to ecological 
sustainability, they need to include a

aquatic and terrestrial environments. 
Ideally, seamless integration is required 
between terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, 
inshore and offshore marine protected 
areas, to maximise the ecological 
sustainability benefits of protected areas.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 6 
Protected areas for climate change 
adaptation 
Healthy natural ecosystems can increase 
resilience to the impacts of climate change, by 
allowing species to adapt as naturally as 
possible to the changes. They also buffer 
human settlements and activities from the 
impacts of extreme climate events. 
A sufficient protected area network supports 
the persistence of biodiversity within the 
broader landscape and safeguards the longterm provision of ecosystem goods and 
services (such as sufficient clean water, 
pollination etc.) on which we all depend, 
especially in the face of stresses such as 
climate change. Intact ecosystems (i.e. 
ecosystems which are in a natural or nearnatural state) withstand stresses better than 
highly modified and fragmented landscapes, 
and natural landscapes secured within 
protected areas are the anchor on which 
survival of broader ecological systems will 
depend. This role of protected areas is worthy 
of greater emphasis in the global debate on 
climate change adaptation. South Africa has a 
unique opportunity to take a global lead in 
giving protected areas a central role in our 
climate change response strategy. 
An implication of this is that protected area 
expansion should prioritise protection of 
natural connected landscapes. Protected 
areas need to be expanded to incorporate 
altitudinal gradients and topographic range, 
intact river corridors, coastal dunes, and a 
greater range of microhabitats, in order to 
conserve the climatic gradients required to 
give us some leeway for climate change. The 
ability of species and systems to adapt to 
climate change will depend on landscapes 
that are sufficiently connected to allow 
species to move. 
Freshwater ecosystems are likely to be 
particularly hard hit by rising temperatures 
and shifting rainfall patterns, and yet healthy, 
intact freshwater ecosystems are vital for 
maintaining resilience to climate change and 
mitigating its impact on human well-being. In 
the western part of South Africa, which is 
likely to become dryer, intact rivers and 
wetlands will help to maintain a consistent 
supply of water. In portions of the country 
that are likely to become wetter, intact rivers 
and wetlands will be important for reducing 
flood risk and mitigating the impacts of flash 
floods. This reinforces the importance of 
including freshwater ecosystems in landbased protected areas, and moving towards 
integrated aquatic and terrestrial design of 
the protected area network. 
Protected areas for land reform and 
rural livelihoods 
Historically, local communities have often 
been only minor recipients of benefits 
generated by protected areas, as in most 
cases they have not been owners of either the 
protected area land or the tourist facilities on 
that land. The opportunity now exists for local 
communities, as potentially major landholders 
through the land reform process, to have full 
access to the economic opportunities 
Healthy natural ecosystems can increase 
resilience to the impacts of climate change, 
by allowing ecosystems and species to 
adapt as naturally as possible to the 
changes and by buffering human 
settlements and activities from the impacts 
of extreme climate events. South Africa has 
an opportunity to take a global lead in 
giving protected areas a central role in our 
climate change response strategy.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 7 
associated with ecotourism. Two good 
examples of this are Nambiti Private Game 
Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal and the !Ae!Hai 
Kalahari Heritage Park together with the !Xaus 
Lodge within the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. 
Scope exists for protected area expansion to 
work in partnership with land reform for 
mutual benefit, actively supporting the land 
reform agenda and the diversification of rural 
livelihoods. 
Contract agreements are used increasingly in 
expansion of the protected area network, and 
represent opportunities for mutual benefit 
between landowners, who receive incentives 
and assistance with management, and 
protected area agencies. It is important to 
note that biodiversity stewardship 
programmes allow for considerable flexibility 
in the nature of agreements concluded. For 
example, it is possible for part of the land 
involved to be formally proclaimed a 
protected area, and part not. The Richtersveld 
National Park, the Makuleke section of Kruger 
National Park and iSimangaliso Wetland Park 
provide good examples of community 
ownership of formal protected areas through 
contract agreements. 
As discussed in the next section on socioeconomic development, protected areas 
often represent the most promising option for 
economic development in rural regions, 
providing more jobs than commercial 
agriculture would. 
Biodiversity stewardship programmes have 
now been developed, and are under 
implementation, in all nine provinces of the 
country, with the potential to contribute to 
land reform. 
Protected areas for socio-economic 
development 
Protected areas are important for socioeconomic development in several ways. They 
can contribute to rural development and local 
economic development with immediate 
benefits to surrounding communities. 
Protected areas also contribute to the 
attractiveness of South Africa as a key 
destination for foreign and national tourists. 
By providing essential ecosystem services, 
protected areas safeguard the wellbeing of 
future generations. 
Protected areas can be a cornerstone for local 
economic development, providing immediate 
socio-economic benefits to surrounding 
communities, especially if this is an explicit 
aspect of the management goals of the 
protected area. Increasingly, there is 
sensitivity in the design and management of 
protected areas to the needs of local and 
regional communities, with protected areas 
seen not as isolated islands but as part of the 
socio-economic, as well as the ecological, 
environment. The DEA’s People and Parks 
programme is significant in this regard. 
In many rural regions, ecotourism based on 
protected areas provides a more viable option 
for economic development and livelihoods 
than agriculture, even though agriculture is 
currently often the main focus for rural socioeconomic development. As mentioned in the 
previous section, land reform provides the 
Scope exists for protected area expansion

of rural livelihoods.
Protected areas can be a cornerstone for 
local economic development, providing 
immediate socio-economic benefits to 
surrounding communitiesNational Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 8 
opportunity for communities to become 
landholders in protected areas and to benefit 
directly from ownership of ecotourism 
ventures. 
Especially in marginal agricultural areas, 
evidence suggests that conservation-related 
industries (protected areas, ecotourism on 
private reserves, game farming etc.) may have 
higher economic potential than agricultural 
activities such as stock farming. Further 
research and support for pilot initiatives is 
required to test this evidence formally and to 
determine whether these economic trends 
can be generalised across South Africa. 
The protected area network forms part of 
South Africa’s competitive advantage as a 
nation, creating destinations for nature-based 
tourism, providing a draw card for 
international interest and attention, and 
acting as a unique selling point for Brand 
South Africa. Our national identity includes 
the spectacular varied natural environment 
that is secured through our protected area 
network. 
Through the protection and management 
they provide for priority ecosystems and 
catchments, protected areas help to secure 
the ecological infrastructure which supports 
the provision of important ecosystem 
services, such as production of clean water, 
flood moderation, prevention of erosion, 
carbon storage, and the aesthetic value of the 
landscape. Mountain catchment areas, in 
particular, play an important role in 
safeguarding water supplies. 
Marine protected areas are vital in sustaining 
commercial, recreational and subsistence 
fisheries resources. There is increasing 
evidence globally that the vast majority of fish 
stocks are fully exploited or overexploited. 
Fishing pressure continues to threaten marine 
ecosystems and the cultures and economies 
that depend on them. Marine protected areas 
can help to address this by protecting 
spawning (breeding) stocks of fish species and 
allowing recovery of overexploited fish 
species. This results in improved fishing yields 
outside of marine protected areas through a 
spillover effect. Often marine protected areas 
are the only areas in which viable numbers of 
reproductive fish are found. It is worth noting 
that no-take marine protected areas or notake zones within marine protected areas, of 
which there are few in South Africa, play this 
role most effectively. 
Finally, by contributing to climate change 
adaptation and protecting aquatic and 
terrestrial ecosystems and the services they 
provide, the protected area network 
safeguards the socio-economic well-being of 
future generations. The costs to future 
generations of not building and maintaining 
an effective protected area network are 
complex to quantify, but we can be sure they 
are substantial. 
The protected area network forms part of 
South Africa’s competitive advantage, 
creating destinations for nature-based 
tourism, providing a draw card for 
international interest and attention, and 
acting as a unique selling point for Brand 
South Africa.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 9 
3. Progress in implementing the NPAES
Measureable progress across a range of indicators was made in implementing the first phase of the 
NPAES. This chapter highlights the new protected areas that were declared in both the marine and 
the terrestrial environments, which increased the spatial extent of a range of protected area types. 
Particularly notable were the expansion efforts in the marine environment, as well as expansion 
achieved as part of the biodiversity stewardship programme. Progress towards achieving specific 
ecosystem targets is presented. This chapter also provides a summary of improvements in 
administering the NPAES and the resources used to do so.
This review covers the progress in 
implementing phase 1 (2008 – 2014) of the 
NPAES. Area values are reported in hectares 
in this chapter to correspond with the targets 
set in NPAES 2008. 
New protected areas declared 
Between 2008 and 2014, a total area of 
18 943 336ha was added to South Africa’s
protected area system through 460 
declarations of individual properties (see 
Table 1 and Figure 3). 
The largest proportion (>95%) of the area 
added to the protected area estate was 
achieved through the declaration of three 
marine protected areas (MPAs), of which the 
Prince Edward Island MPA was by far the 
largest (18 085 137ha). 
Of the 830 322ha of terrestrial protected 
areas declared in the first phase, 270 284ha 
was declared as National Parks, 348 515ha as 
Nature Reserves, 14 850ha as Forest Nature 
Reserves and 196 673ha as Protected 
Environments. Over 561 000ha (67%) of the 
properties declared as terrestrial protected 
areas were either privately owned 
(502 692ha) or under some form of communal 
tenure (59 175ha). This suggests that the 
negotiation of formal contractual agreements 
with landowners and communal rights holders 
has become the primary tool for protected 
area expansion efforts in the terrestrial 
environment.

Progress towards achieving 
protected area targets 
The progress in achieving phase 1 
representation targets8
 for terrestrial 
ecosystem types in the protected area system 
is summarised in Table 2. When individual 
ecosystems are considered, the area 
contributing to meeting ecosystem targets 
improved from 3.6% to 3.9% of the total 
terrestrial area. This represents 18% of the 
phase 1 target. Biozones where good progress 
was made towards meeting underlying 
ecosystem representation targets in phase 1 
include Forests (129% of the phase 1 target),
water bodies (91%) and Albany Thicket (69%). 
No progress was made however in the Desert 
 
8
 This target achievement is measured against the 
NPAES 2008. These targets are changed in the 
current NPAES revision.
9
 As in NPAES 2008, de facto protected areas are 
included. These are functioning as protected areas 
biozone and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, while 
limited progress was made in the Nama-Karoo 
(9%), Savanna (14%) and Grassland (16%). 
In the marine environment, the declaration of 
a single MPA in the Prince Edward Island 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) resulted in this 
area substantially exceeding the phase 1 
target. In fact, the long-term target was 
exceeded by a factor of almost two and the 
no-take target nearly met (Table 3). In 
mainland marine systems, two inshore MPAs 
(278km2
) were declared. As a result, the 5-
year NPAES inshore target measured in terms 
of coast length for no-take areas was almost 
met, with 89% of the phase 1 target being 
achieved, while 163% of the phase 1 target for 
but are not formally declared. Formalising their 
status is critical to ensuring that they continue to 
contribute to the protected area network.

.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 11
overall inshore protection was met. This 
placed South Africa in a good position to 
achieve the full 20-year Marine Inshore 
targets. Little progress was made towards 
achieving the marine offshore area targets 
with the 278km2
 being under 1% of the 
phase 1 target of 52 182 km2
.

10 Effective area refers to the area that is 
contributing to meeting representation targets. 
This does not imply that these areas don’t have 
value as there are valid reasons to have areas 
declared in excess of the minimum representation 
target. It merely indicates that these areas are in 
excess of the representation target. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 12
Mechanisms of expansion 
All three available protected area expansion 
mechanisms for terrestrial protected areas 
(contractual agreement, land acquisition and 
declaration of state owned land) were 
successfully implemented in phase 1. The 
breakdown of the extent of the area declared, 
by implementing agency, using each of the 
different expansion mechanisms is 
summarised in Table 4 below. The negotiation 
and conclusion of contractual agreements 
with landowners was the predominant 
protected area expansion mechanism 
adopted by most of the protected area 
agencies. During the phase 1 review, 
protected area institutions reported that a 
further 1 100 000ha was still under some form 
of contractual negotiation with landowners 
for future declaration as protected areas. 
Implementation, resourcing and 
administration of the NPAES 
The implementation of the NPAES is primarily 
the responsibility of the 12 protected area 
agencies11. By the end of phase 1, eight (up 
from only one in 2008) of the 12 protected 
area agencies had developed, adopted and 
were implementing an institutionally-based 
Protected Area Expansion Strategy (PAES) that 
is closely aligned to the strategic objectives of 
the NPAES. The remaining agencies – with the 
exception of DAFF, which has no plans to 
develop an institutionally-based PAES – were 
well advanced in preparing these strategies. 
Expansion plans for the marine environment 
are well developed, and were recently 
published as part of Operation Phakisa12
.

The negotiations and conclusion of 
contractual agreements with landowners 
was the predominant mechanism for 
protected area expansion in phase 1.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 13
The institutional capacity to implement the 
protected area expansion programme is 
limited, with an estimated total of 28 staff 
(that are unevenly distributed between 
institutions) contributing more than 60% of 
their time to protected area expansion. 
The reported annual operational budgets for 
protected area expansion are also highly 
variable across institutions. It is estimated 
that a total of R61.75 million was available for 
protected area expansion efforts during the 
2014/2015 financial year. Of this total 
amount, R34.5 million forms part of the South 
African National Parks (SANParks) budget and 
R12 million is set aside for marine protected 
area expansion, leaving approximately R15 
million distributed across the remaining ten 
protected area institutions. 
Phase 1 of the NPAES saw a number of legal 
and administrative developments that 
advanced protected area expansion. In this 
regard it is noted that: 
 The Protected Areas Act was amended to 
include marine protected areas. 
 
13 DEA., 2009 
 The process of developing standardised 
Biodiversity Stewardship Guidelines13 and 
a national Biodiversity Stewardship Policy 
was significantly advanced. 
 Incentives for declaring privately owned 
and managed protected areas through tax 
rebates were piloted and further refined 
 Levels of legislative compliance were 
improved through the development of the 
Protected Area Register. 
 The development of a robust, spatial 
protected area database, linked to the 
Protected Area Register. 
 Guidelines for the declaration of different 
types of protected areas were published. 
More information on the review of progress 
made in phase 1 of the NPAES is given in 
Appendix 3.

4. Protected area targets
Protected area targets are action targets that indicate how much of each ecosystem should be 
included in protected areas. They help to focus protected area expansion on the least protected 
ecosystems, and provide the basis for assessments. The NPAES uses the established biodiversity 
targets for each ecosystem from the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) as the long-term 
protected area targets. This ensures that targets are scientifically robust and have an ecological 
basis, while also ensuring that no further ecosystems become Critically Endangered, and that the 
NBA and the NPAES are aligned. The 20-year targets are designed to achieve overall CBD Aichi 
biodiversity targets, while optimally shifting the emphasis onto high biodiversity value ecosystems. 
Clear principles and a repeatable method are established for target setting, which will enable easy 
updates and allow provinces and agencies to calculate compatible targets.
This chapter presents several major improvements that have been made to the protected area 
targets in this revision of the NPAES. These include comprehensive targets for wetlands, rivers, 
estuaries and specific marine ecosystems, as well as terrestrial ecosystem types. A new integrated 
ecosystem map has been created and ecological condition has been included in the assessment. 
South Africa’s current protected area network still falls far short of sustaining biodiversity and 
ecological processes. The current achievement of targets has been evaluated, protection levels are 
mapped and the extent to which the current protected area network falls short of the targets is 
presented.
Protected area targets are action targets that 
indicate how much of each ecosystem should 
be included in protected areas, thus guiding 
protected area expansion to focus on 
ecosystems that are least protected.14
Internationally, the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD) to which South Africa is a 
signatory, commits governments to a range of 
targets generally known as Aichi biodiversity 
 
14 More information about protected area targets 
can be found in Technical Note 1 of Appendix 2. 
15 CBD, 2010. 
16 Biodiversity targets are sometimes called 
biodiversity thresholds. See Driver et al., 2012 for 
targets15. Target 11 states that “by 2020, at 
least 17% of terrestrial and inland water 
areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas, 
especially areas of particular importance for 
biodiversity and ecosystem services, are 
conserved through effectively and equitably 
managed, ecologically representative and well 
connected systems of protected areas and 
other effective area-based conservation 
measures, and integrated into the wider 
landscape and seascape”. 
South Africa has a well-established system of 
systematic biodiversity planning which uses 
biodiversity targets16 to determine which 
areas of the landscape and seascape are most 
explanations the systematic conservation planning 
approach used in South Africa and details on how 
biodiversity targets are determined and used in 
the evaluations of ecosystem protection level. 
Protected area targets are action targets 
that indicate how much of each ecosystem 
should be included in protected areas, this

on ecosystems that are least protected.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 15
important for conserving a representative 
sample of biodiversity pattern (ecosystems 
and species) and for keeping key ecological 
processes intact. These targets are used as the 
basis for national monitoring of Protection 
Level in the NBA. 
The system and target values set out in the 
NBA 2011 are widely used and well-accepted 
across South Africa, including in the National 
Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas 
Assessment (NFEPA) project17, prioritisation 
for marine protected areas in projects such as 
the Offshore Marine Protected Area (OMPA) 
project18, and the National Estuary 
Biodiversity Plan for South Africa 201219. The 
same ecosystem targets are used in provincial 
conservation plans. Biodiversity targets for 
terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa range 
from 16% to 36% of the original extent of 
each ecosystem, with higher targets for more 
variable and species-rich ecosystems. In the 
absence of better data, a 20% biodiversity 
target is used for marine, river, wetland and 
estuarine systems. 
The NPAES 2016 retains many core principles 
established for the NPAES 2008, including: 
 Long-term protected area targets should 
align with established biodiversity targets. 
This means that, in principle, enough of 
each ecosystem will be protected to 
ensure that no further ecosystems can 
become Critically Endangered. It also 
allows for consistent reporting by the NBA 
and NPAES. 
 Targets should be specifically set for each 
ecosystem. Although for convenience 
they can be reported for broader units 
 
17 Nel et al., 2011. 
18 Sink et al., 2011.
19 Turpie et al., 2012.
20 The CBD targets have changed since NPAES 2008 
(from 12%) to 17% for terrestrial areas and 10% 
for marine systems. 
such as a biozone, the actual target is set 
at the ecosystem level. 
 Over a 20-year period, South Africa should 
aim to achieve its commitments under the 
CBD20 even if the convention’s timelines 
are not adhered to. 
 The allocation of targets is optimised 
across ecosystems to reflect differing 
levels of biodiversity, i.e. increased targets 
for diverse ecosystems, but reduced 
targets in those with relatively low 
diversity, so that overall South Africa will 
achieve its CBD commitment. 
Some additional elements have been added in 
the NPAES 2016. Firstly, and most 
importantly, targets have now been set for 
marine, wetland, river and estuarine features 
at the ecosystem level, in addition to the 
terrestrial targets. To do this, a new fully 
integrated ecosystem map was prepared, 
covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, 
coastal and marine ecosystems (Figure 4)
21
. 
Separate maps for each of these ecosystems 
were available, but overlaps between 
ecosystems (for example a terrestrial and 
river ecosystem) could result in double 
counting and inaccurate targets. A single 
integrated map was therefore developed that 
identified 969 distinct ecosystems in 26 
biozones22
. 
21 More information about the integrated 
ecosystem map can be found in Technical Note 3 
of Appendix 2. 
22 Biozones are major habitat units. In the 
terrestrial environment, they are the same as 
biomes, but the term biozone is used so that 
A new, fully integrated ecosystem map was 
prepared, covering terrestrial, river, 
wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine 
ecosystems.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 16
The second addition in the NPAES 2016 is that 
targets can only be met in intact habitat. This 
principle was established in the NPAES 2008 
but was only partially implemented as only 
artificial waterbodies were excluded at that 
time. The underlying principle is that areas 
that are no longer intact (e.g. large dams, 
roads, rest camps, canalised sections of rivers 
and plantations of exotic trees) should not 
contribute to targets even if they are in 
protected areas. Hence, the preparation of a 
fully integrated ecosystem condition map was 
a key activity for the NPAES. This process 
produced the first ever integrated map of 
ecosystem condition for South Africa, which 
identified good, fair and poor condition areas 
of each ecosystem (Figure 5)
23
.
 
equivalent river, wetland and marine habitat units 
can be included. 
Targets can be met in protected areas and 
other areas with effective area-based 
conservation measures. Currently, we only 
evaluate protected areas, as these are the 
only areas where biodiversity is currently 
legally secured. In the future, once other areabased conservation mechanisms have been 
secured effectively (e.g. through having intact 
natural areas of biospheres strictly zoned for 
conservation), subject to robust and effective 
land use controls, and have well-capacitated 
management authorities, it is anticipated that 
23 More information about the integrated 
condition map can be found in Technical Note 4 of 
Appendix 2. 
Targets can only be met in intact habitat. 
Hence, the first ever integrated map of 
ecosystem condition was produced for 
South Africa.
Figure 4: An integrated ecosystem map was created for South Africa. Inserts show the Prince Edward 
Islands and offshore pelagic ecosystems.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 17
the intact and secure areas zoned for 
conservation under these other measures will 
also contribute to meeting targets. 
Calculating protected area targets 
The NPAES has established a system that sets 
robust targets, but which can be quickly and 
easily updated when changes in any of the 
input elements occur24. In brief, the 
biodiversity targets for each ecosystem are 
identified from the NBA, and these are used 
as the long-term protected area targets. To 
calculate the 20-year targets, the ratio 
between the total area required to meet 
South Africa’s CBD commitments and the total 
area needed to meet the long-term protected 
area target is then calculated25
. This ratio is 
used to identify what proportion of the long-
 
24 More information on how targets are calculated 
can be found in Technical Note 2 of Appendix 2. 
term target is required over the next 20 years. 
Based on current values, the 20-year 
protected area targets for marine ecosystems 
are 50% of the long-term biodiversity targets, 
while those for terrestrial ecosystems are 
78.63%. Shorter term protected area targets 
(e.g. 5-year target) are calculated as a portion 
of the 20-year target. 
The target setting approach outlined here was 
applied using the integrated ecosystem map 
specially created for this strategy, which 
produced the values reflected in the tables, 
analyses and appendices of this report, but 
the same approach can be applied to any 
other ecosystem map. This allows provinces 
to use finer scale local ecosystem maps for 
their target setting and planning processes, 
25 This was calculated separately for terrestrial and 
marine systems. Coastal ecosystems, which have a 
land component, were treated as terrestrial. 
Figure 5: An integrated ecosystem condition map was created for South Africa. Inserts show the 
condition of the Prince Edward Islands and offshore pelagic ecosystems.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 18
while remaining fully compatible with the 
NPAES approach and required overall target.
Summary of protected area targets
The final target percentages for the NPAES 
2016 are summarized in Table 5. Importantly, 
the underlying targets are set at the 
ecosystem level, which are given in detail in 
Appendix 1. The long-term protected area 
targets, which are the same as the 
biodiversity targets, range from 16% to 36% of 
original extent. The 20-year protected area
targets range from 10% to 28.3%, with many 
systems such as coastal types, wetlands, 
estuaries and rivers having a target of 15.7%.
Table 6 summarizes the total areas required 
to meet the targets. A total of 574 735km2
, of 
which 363 392km2
 is the 20-year target, is 
required to meet long-term protected area 
targets for all ecosystems except marine 
pelagic ecosystems. The long-term target for 
marine pelagic ecosystems is 214 719 km2
, 
107 359km2
 of which should be protected in 
the next 20-years. In many cases, targets for 
pelagic ecosystems and offshore benthic 
ecosystems could be met by the same 
protected area as these ecosystems overlap. 
Fortunately, large areas required to meet 
many of these targets are already included in 
existing protected areas. The next section 
describes the current level of achievement of 
targets within the current protected area 
network.

Current achievement of targets 
29With protected area targets determined for 
each ecosystem type, the next step is to 
evaluate how much of each ecosystem type is 
already effectively conserved in the protected 
area network. To do this, we need to

ecosystem condition map (Figure 5) and

condition map is required to ensure that only 
intact areas are counted. Table 7 gives a 
summary of the protected area targets for all 
ecosystems and evaluates the current 
protected area network in terms of its 
achievement of these targets. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 21

The shortfall in terms of achieving the longterm protected area targets shows that South 
Africa’s current protected area network is still 
inadequate to sustain biodiversity and 
ecological processes. To meet the long-term 
 
30 Importantly, the actual 20-year shortfall is larger than initial inspection of the targets and current protected 
areas would suggest because only the intact areas can meet targets and the current protected area extent 
includes areas which may be in excess of the minimum area required to meet targets for an individual 
ecosystem. See Appendix 2 for more detail. 
protected area target we need to add 
413 163km2
 to the protected area network, of 
which 211 896km2
 should be in protected 
areas securing marine benthic and coastal 
ecosystems. An additional amount of National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 22
212 140km2
 is needed to secure marine 
pelagic ecosystems. 
To meet the 20-year targets, we need to add 
255 877km2
 to the protected area network. 
This is made up of 104 962km2
 required for 
marine benthic and coastal ecosystems, 
146 814km2
 for terrestrial ecosystems, 
2 352km2
 for wetlands, 1 490km2
 for rivers 
and 259km2
 for estuaries. As discussed 
previously, pelagic ecosystems are dealt with 
separately and require 104 780km2
 to meet 
the 20-year targets. 
It is important to remember that the 
aggregated protected area targets in Table 7
are built up from more detailed ecosystem 
level targets, which are discussed in the 
sections that follow. These specific targets are 
crucial for ensuring that protected area 
expansion doesn’t just provide more 
protection for already well-protected 
ecosystems. 
The ‘protection level’ of an ecosystem 
provides a simple way to visualise and 
understand how well ecosystems are 
represented in the protected area network. 
The ecosystem protection level is evaluated 
using the same methods and categories as the 
NBA (Table 8). These categories range from 
‘Not Protected’, through intermediate 
categories to ‘Well Protected’. The number of 
ecosystems in each of these categories are 
reported per biozone in Table 9 and mapped 
in Figure 6. 
Of the 969 distinct ecosystem types, 201 
(21%) are Well Protected, 122 (13%) types are 
Moderately Protected, 286 (30%) ecosystem 
types are Poorly Protected, while 360 (37%) 
ecosystem types are Not Protected. The 
following sections explore the ecosystem 
protection levels of marine, inland aquatic 
and terrestrial ecosystem groups in more 
detail. 
Table 8: Categories used for evaluation of ecosystem protection levels. The categories are the same as those 
applied in the National Biodiversity Assessment.

Achievement of marine targets 
There are very distinct patterns of 
achievement of protected area targets for 
marine ecosystems (Figure 7). Coastal 
ecosystems are generally the best protected 
of the marine biozones. 273km2
 of coastal 
ecosystems, out of a target of 322km2
, has 
already been protected, with 91km2
 still being 
required to meet the full long-term target and 
47km2 to meet the 20-year target (Table 7). 
Figure 7 shows that 12 coastal ecosystem 
types (38%) are Well Protected, 14 are 
Moderately Protected (44%), 3 are Poorly 
Protected (9%) and 3 are Not Protected (9%). 
Despite this relatively healthy situation, some 
important gaps remain. Firstly, the West Coast 
is very under-protected, with 5 of the Poorly 
Protected and Not Protected ecosystem types 
being found here. Secondly, to properly 
secure marine ecosystems, at least 75% of 
each ecosystem’s targets should be included 
into no-take zones. ‘Controlled’ or ‘take’
zones in marine protected areas can actually 
become nodes for increased exploitation by 
facilitating fishing access, rather than 
providing protection. Urgent attention should 
be given to reducing the impact of 
recreational fishing activities in the controlled 
zones within marine protected areas. The 
current pressure to downgrade some longstanding marine protected areas from no-take 
to ‘controlled’ could undermine recent 
progress in marine protected area 
declaration. 
Figure 6: Current protection levels of South African terrestrial (including Sub-Antarctic 
ecosystems), river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine (including pelagic) ecosystems.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 25
The remaining shallow water systems (i.e. 
inner shelf, inshore, island, and lagoon) show 
variation in terms of current inclusion in the 
protected area network. Overall, 2 ecosystem 
types (12%) are Not Protected, 5 types (29%) 
are Poorly Protected, 7 types (41%) are 
Moderately Protected and 3 types (18%) are 
Well Protected (Figure 7). The largest gaps are 
in the inner shelf and island biozones, where 
significant additional areas are required, in 
particular along the West Coast where very 
few systems have any effective protection. A 
number of inshore types along the East and 
South-East Coast have some level of 
protection, with most of the 3 Well Protected 
and 5 Moderately Protected Inshore types 
being found along this coast. The single 
lagoon ecosystem (Langebaan) is Moderately 
Protected. For all these ecosystems, a key 
issue is that even where there is some 
protection, few of these areas are declared 
no-take reserves.

The full target is met for the Southern Oceans, 
since declaration of the recent marine 
protected area. In contrast, mainland offshore 
benthic marine ecosystems currently have 
almost no protection, with 41 types (68%) 
categorised as Not Protected (Figure 7). 
Protection levels of marine pelagic 
ecosystems are even worse, with protected 
areas securing only 2% of the 20-year target. 
This is reflected by the fact that 14 types 
(88%) are Not Protected with the remaining 2 
types (12%) being Poorly Protected. 
Fortunately, this situation is currently 
changing with the declaration of marine 
protected areas through Operation Phakisa. 
To summarise, the focus for marine protected 
area expansion in the next five years should 
be securing the improved protection of 
marine ecosystems through Operation 
Phakisa. In addition, significant progress is 
needed in inshore regions and some coastal 
regions, particularly along the West Coast. A 
key issue is declaring sufficient no-take areas 
to ensure that marine ecosystems are 
effectively secured against fishing pressure. 
Otherwise, the benefits of declaring marine 
protected areas will be undermined. 
Achievement of targets for inland 
aquatic ecosystems 
Unlike in the NPAES 2008, specific targets 
have now been set for inland aquatic 
ecosystems (rivers, wetlands and estuaries). 
All three inland aquatic biozones are very 
poorly represented in the protected area 
network (Figure 8), which has a traditional 
bias towards terrestrial ecosystems. Further, 
many of the aquatic ecosystems that do occur 
within protected area boundaries are often in 
poor condition and are, therefore, not 
effectively secured.
The focus for marine protected area 
expansion should be on improved 
protection of marine ecosystems through 
Operation Phakisa, and on under-protected 
inshore and coastal regions, particularly 
along the West Coast. Sufficient no-take 
areas are needed to effectively secure 
marine ecosystems.

This is most obvious in estuaries, where even 
though the current protected area network of 
724km2
 exceeds the total required to meet 
targets, there is still a shortfall in actual target 
achievement (Table 7). This results from two 
issues. Firstly, although some large estuaries 
are conserved and targets are exceeded for 
those types, many ecosystems remain 
unprotected. Secondly, much of the estuary 
area within protected areas is in fact in a poor 
condition due to catchment related impacts 
and hence does not contribute to meeting 
targets. 
Currently, 93% of the 43 estuary types are 
effectively Not Protected (Figure 8). Overall, 
259km2
 of additional estuary protection is 
necessary over the next 20 years. Securing 
estuaries effectively in the protected area 
network is going to require both expansion 
into under-protected types and improved 
management of estuaries and their 
catchments. 
Rivers are very poorly represented within the 
protected area network, with 69 ecosystem 
types (33%) being classified as Not Protected, 
and 79 (37%) as Poorly Protected. The 
remaining 63 types are fairly evenly spread 
between Moderately Protected (12%) and 
Well Protected types (18%). Currently, river 
ecosystems are well below targets, with only 
871km2
 both protected and in acceptable 
condition. In order to secure full 
representation of rivers, an additional 
2 009km2
 of river ecosystems is required in 
the long-term, of which 1 490km2
 is needed 
within 20 years (Table 7). 
Protection of rivers is particularly important 
as they represent vital ecological 
infrastructure for the country, i.e. they are 
responsible for delivering important 
ecosystem services to people. As was the case 
 
31 Nel et al., 2011. 
for estuaries, protection of rivers is not 
ensured merely by including the river within a 
protected area, though this is a good starting 
point. Full protection requires that 
catchments are effectively managed, that 
important areas for generating runoff are 
secured (i.e. South Africa’s Strategic Water 
Source Areas31), that abstraction is carefully 
controlled, and that riparian areas and 
floodplains are maintained. 
Wetlands are even more poorly represented 
in the protected area network than river 
ecosystems. As many as 53 wetland 
ecosystem types (39%) are Not Protected, 
with an additional 40 types (29%) being Poorly 
Protected. Long-term targets are only met for 
the 24 types (18%) which are Well Protected, 
with another 19 types (14%) categorised as 
Moderately Protected. The very poor 
protection of wetlands is illustrated by the 
fact that of the 4 039km2
 long-term and 
3 176km2 20-year targets required, only 
1 139km2
 is met by wetlands that are both 
included acceptable condition and in a 
protected area (Table 7). Consequently, a 
significant shortfall of 3 135km2
 exists in the 
long-term and 2 352km2
 is required over the 
next 20-years. It is clear that a far more 
targeted protection effort is required in order 
that South Africa sufficiently secures its 
wetlands. As was the case for rivers, wetlands 
represent key ecological infrastructure, and 
securing them can maintain important 
benefits in terms of the delivery of ecosystem 
services to people. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 28
In summary, inland aquatic ecosystems 
(rivers, wetlands and estuaries) are very 
poorly represented in protected areas, and 
many of the areas that are included are in 
poor condition. There is a dual challenge to 
substantially improve the protected area 
coverage of inland aquatic systems and at the 
same time secure their functioning. This 
requires careful management of catchments, 
securing effective management of key areas 
such as water source areas, floodplains and 
riparian areas, as well as improved 
management of wetlands within current 
protected areas. Although the challenge is 
great, the benefits are potentially far greater, 
as inland aquatic ecosystems are amongst 
South Africa’s most important ecological 
infrastructure. 
Achievement of terrestrial targets 
(mainland and Sub-Antarctic) 
Overall, of the 445 mainland terrestrial 
ecosystem types, 25% are Well Protected, 
12% are Moderately Protected, 33% are 
Poorly Protected and 30% are Not Protected 
(Figure 9). The overall low levels of protection 
are emphasised when one examines the 
actual targets (Table 7). Of the long-term 
target of 257 671km2
 and the 20-year target 
of 202 604km2
, only 93 381km2
 is currently 
included in the protected area network in 
acceptable condition. This leaves a long-term 
requirement for 195 793km2
, of which 
146 814km2
 is required over 20-years. This 
equates to 36 703km2
 in 5-years or 7 340km2
per year (i.e. 734 000ha a year). It is clear that 
South Africa is a long way from having a fully a 
protected area network that is fully 
representative of all mainland terrestrial 
ecosystems In a welcome contrast to the 
mainland systems, all five Sub-Antarctic 
terrestrial ecosystem types are fully included 
in the protected area network. 
If we examine the individual biozones, it is 
clear that there is much variation in 
protection (Figure 10). Forests are by far the 
best protected, with 9 ecosystem types (75%) 
being Well Protected and the remaining 3 
types (25%) being Moderately Protected.

Figure 10: Current protection levels for terrestrial ecosystems, divided according to biozones.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 30
None of the other terrestrial biozones have 
similar levels of protection. The Desert 
biozone has 6 types (40%) categorised as Well 
Protected, but 8 types (53%) are Not 
Protected. Effectively, Desert ecosystems in 
the west and east are well represented, but 
central types are not. There is a similar 
situation for Fynbos ecosystems, with 43 
types (35%) being Well Protected, but 41 
types (34%) remain Poorly Protected and 31 
types (25%) are Not Protected. Many 
mountain and some coastal Fynbos 
ecosystems are well represented by the 
protected area network, but lowland and 
midland types remain very poorly conserved. 
Savanna has a similar contrast, with 28% Well 
Protected ecosystem types, but 33% that 
remain Poorly Protected and 20% are Not 
Protected. Large Savanna focused protected 
areas secure the Lowveld and the arid 
Savannas, but much of the remaining mesic 
Savanna is very poorly protected. Hence, even 
in biozones that initially appear relatively well 
conserved there significant gaps in protection. 
These poorly represented ecosystems are just 
as deserving of protection as any other underprotected type, and the need to protect them 
is not reduced by good protection of other 
ecosystems in their biozone. 
Overall, the Nama-Karoo is South Africa’s least 
protected biozone, with 8 types (57%) 
categorised as Not Protected, and an 
additional 5 types (36%) remain Poorly 
Protected. In the past, protection of the 
Nama-Karoo was not seen as urgent because 
there were no imminent threats and it 
appeared that opportunities for protection 
would be available for the foreseeable future. 
However, shale gas exploration and 
production could now potentially foreclose 
protected area expansion opportunities 
across much of the Nama-Karoo. This 
illustrates how protected area expansion 
efforts should be balanced between securing 
remaining fragments of already pressured 
ecosystems, with strategically securing areas 
before they become fragmented. It is clear 
that protected area expansion in the NamaKaroo has suddenly become urgent and that 
opportunities for significant protection at low 
cost may have already been lost. 
Grasslands are the second most underrepresented terrestrial biozone, with 24 types 
(33%) being classified as Not Protected and 37 
types (51%) as Poorly Protected. Few choices 
exist for meeting protected area targets in 
Grasslands because of many competing land 
and resource uses, and there is a need to act 
quickly to secure remaining options. The 
Succulent Karoo is in a very similar position to 
the Grasslands, 30 types (47%) are Not 
Protected and 15 types (23%) are Poorly 
Protected. Expansion of protected areas in the 
remaining under-represented types in the 
Succulent Karoo is also a priority. 
In summary, terrestrial biozones show 
variable levels of protection. Sub-Antarctic 
ecosystem types are fully protected. Some 
ecosystems within Forests, Deserts and 
Savannas have good protection, but other 
ecosystems in these biozones remain underprotected. The most under-protected 
biozones are the Nama-Karoo, Grasslands and 
Succulent Karoo. In these biozones it is 
important to take all opportunities for further 
protection, as competing land and resource 
uses continue to expand. 
Sub-Antarctic ecosystems are fully 
protected, but the Nama-Karoo, Grassland 
and Succulent Karoo biozones remain 
significantly under-represented. Protected 
area expansion in these biozones is urgent, 
as competing land and resource uses 
continue to reduce opportunities for 
protection.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 31
5. Priority areas for protected area expansion
Having set protected area targets, the next step is to determine which geographic areas are the 
highest priorities for protected area expansion to meet those targets.
The NPAES takes the approach that the national role is not to undertake the spatial planning, but 
rather to set targets, identify key underlying planning principles, collate the provincial and sector 
priorities, and identify any remaining gaps. The strategy recognizes that detailed planning, 
scheduling and operational issues are all best dealt with at the provincial and agency level. In the 
NPAES 2008, spatial priorities had to be established nationally as few provinces or agencies had 
conservation plans and even fewer had specific sets of protected area expansion priorities. This has 
changed sufficiently for a set of priority areas to be collated directly from provincial and agency 
plans. The NPAES 2016 brings together these priorities, and highlights ecosystems where, if fully 
implemented, the current set of priorities will not achieve targets.
The identified priority areas cover a total area of 190 109km2
, in addition to areas currently under 
negotiation covering 73 610km2 of mostly marine areas. The priority areas for each province, as well 
as for marine systems, are summarized. Overall, the set of priorities is well aligned with 
requirements for improving the representation of most ecosystems over the next 20 years. The 
number of Well Protected ecosystems is anticipated to more than double, while Not Protected 
ecosystems will reduce by around 70%. Assuming effective implementation the priority areas, 
greatest progress is anticipated in the Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna, wetlands, rivers and 
offshore benthic and pelagic ecosystems.
Chapter 4 addressed how much intact and 
functional area of each ecosystem type should 
be included in the protected area network if it 
is to be fully representative and play its role in 
ensuring that no further ecosystems become 
Critically Endangered. Once targets have been 
set, the next step is to determine which 
geographic areas are the highest priorities for 
protected area expansion to meet those 
targets. 
Although the overall aim should be improving 
the representivity and efficiency of the 
protected area network, planning needs to 
take a far wider set of issues into account. 
These include detailed analysis of important 
areas for ecosystem processes (e.g. to secure 
areas against the impacts of climate change), 
and the identification of key areas of 
ecological infrastructure that will ensure that 
protected areas contribute to delivering key 
ecosystem services to people. Further, 
implementation prioritisation should reflect 
operational requirements (e.g. consolidation 
of protected areas to aid management) and 
the implementation mechanisms being used 
(e.g. the use of biodiversity stewardship 
programmes).
When the NPAES 2008 was developed, most 
provinces did not have systematic 
conservation plans and even fewer had 
specified sets of protected area expansion 
priorities. It was therefore necessary to 
prioritise at a national level. Little was known 
about inland aquatic and marine priorities. 
This situation has changed substantially, with 
most provinces, agencies and sectors having 
robust and systematically identified spatial 
priorities. All terrestrial, freshwater and National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 32
marine areas now have functional protected 
area expansion strategies (PAES). 
The national planning approach is therefore 
no longer necessary or appropriate, and 
instead the role of the NPAES 2016 is to set 
targets, review the collated spatial priorities 
and identify gaps, rather than undertaking its 
own spatial prioritisation. The NPAES 2016 is 
therefore collated from the protected area 
expansion priorities of the individual 
protected area agencies. The strategy 
recognises that detailed protected area 
expansion planning is best dealt with at the 
provincial and agency level. Many planning 
issues (e.g. ecosystem service issues, 
identification of ecological infrastructure, 
protected area management issues, 
implementation negotiations, and 
practicalities of expansion in particular areas) 
are most effectively dealt with at a subnational level. Hence, the NPAES focuses on 
the overall principles which should be applied 
during protected area expansion planning at 
the agency and provincial level. 
In this chapter, the priority areas for each 
province, as well as for marine systems, are 
summarised in terms of how they were 
identified, their location, the key biodiversity 
features, and the key pressures on these 
priority areas. The anticipated situation in 
terms of protection levels of terrestrial, river, 
wetland, estuarine and marine ecosystems is 
evaluated assuming all the priority areas are 
successfully implemented. The ecosystems 
that are not fully addressed by the current set 
of priority areas are identified. Further, we 
evaluate the anticipated rate of 
implementation of priority areas in terms of 
the current implementation rates from the 
provinces and agencies. 
Key principles for planning and 
implementation 
It is anticipated that, over time, provinces and 
agencies will refine, revise and adapt their 
systematic conservation plans and PAES as 
implementation is rolled out, landscapes 
change (e.g. loss of intact habitat), knowledge 
is improved (e.g. revised ecosystem mapping) 
and planning processes are improved. The 
following key principles are intended to guide 
further protected area expansion planning 
and implementation, so that robust 
prioritisation is maintained: 
Systematic approach: Protected area 
expansion planning should be closely linked to 
spatial priorities identified in provincial 
systematic conservation plans. In other cases, 
the planning may take place at a broader scale 
(e.g. for marine systems) or more locally (e.g. 
systematic expansion planning for a particular 
protected area). There should be strong 
alignment with identified Critical Biodiversity 
Areas and Ecological Support Areas (or 
equivalent categories). In most cases the 
identified protected area expansion priorities 
should be a subset of these categories in the 
applicable systematic conservation plan for an 
area.
Detailed planning is best dealt with at 
provincial and agency level. Protected area 
priorities are now available at this level for 
all terrestrial, freshwater and marine areas.
The role of the NPAES 2016 is to collate 
these priorities and identify gaps, rather 
than undertaking national prioritisation.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 33
Target driven: Prioritisation should focus on 
meeting targets for ecosystems. There should 
be a clear link between national targets and 
those used in local level planning. This issue is 
linked to the following two key points on 
representation and efficiency. 
Improve representation of all ecosystems:
Overall, planning for expansion of a protected 
area network should strive to improve 
representation of all ecosystems. It may not 
be possible, cost-effective or necessary to 
secure the full target for all ecosystem types 
through a protected area mechanism. Other 
effective conservation mechanisms may be 
more appropriate in some cases (e.g. 
appropriate zoning or development controls 
could be used in urban situations). 
Nevertheless, the starting point should be 
that all ecosystems should be represented in 
the protected area network to some extent, 
and that one should attempt to secure as 
much of the ecosystem targets in protected 
areas as is practically possible. 
Improve efficiency: There are many valid 
reasons to have a greater portion of an 
ecosystem protected than the targets require. 
For example, a protected area may have a 
significant economic, social or tourism role; it 
may be necessary to protect some other 
biodiversity feature (e.g. a key threatened 
species); or it may be necessary to secure a 
larger area to protect ecological infrastructure 
and ensure long-term climate change 
persistence. For ecosystem types with a 
limited extent, it may not be effective to only 
protect a portion of the system. In other 
instances, significant gains in management 
efficiency may override representation 
efficiency. However, the overall aim should be 
to improve the efficiency of meeting targets. 
This implies that where targets for an 
ecosystem have already been met, there 
needs to be a clear and rational reason for 
including more of that ecosystem before 
under-represented ecosystems are addressed. 
Ecological persistence: Protected areas 
should secure areas critical for maintaining 
ecological process. This will ensure that 
protected areas themselves are able to adapt 
to climate change and that they contribute to 
society as a whole adapting to climate change 
impacts. Key areas include coastal and inland 
corridors, areas important for hydrological 
process (e.g. riparian areas), and areas with 
important altitudinal, climatic and ecological 
gradients. 
Ecological infrastructure: Protected area 
planning should include issues related to the 
protection of natural areas that deliver critical 
ecosystem services to people. Ecological 
infrastructure linked to water-related 
ecosystem services are particularly critical, 
e.g. Strategic Water Source Areas. 
Integrated planning across ecosystem types:
Ideally planning should take place across 
terrestrial, river, wetland and marine systems 
to ensure that optimal areas are selected that 
will deliver a complete set of priority areas. 
Integrated planning for threatened species:
Priorities for threatened species should be 
fully incorporated into the analysis. 
Alignment between provinces and agencies:
Where ecosystems are shared between 
provinces, or where multiple agencies are 
active in a province, it is critical that clear 
communication lines exist and that planning 
processes are linked. This is necessary to 
ensure that priorities are aligned. For 
example, one should ensure that activities are 
not artificially focused in difficult to 
implement areas (e.g. where one province has 
a highly fragmented portion of an ecosystem 
that would be better protected in an adjacent 
province), that shared priority areas are 
consistently dealt with, and that boundary National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 34
areas between biozones (e.g. coastal areas) 
are sensibly planned. Where a national agency 
is operating in a portion of a province it 
should take provincial priorities into account, 
and conversely, provinces should incorporate 
the national agency’s priorities. 
Address receding opportunities: Where 
limited opportunities exist to secure the last 
remaining portions of under-represented 
ecosystems, it is critical that these are 
prioritised. Although it may not be possible or 
cost-effective to secure all these areas 
through protected area expansion, it is 
important that this decision is made on a 
rational basis and that alternative 
mechanisms are used to secure these areas. 
At the other extreme, there may be some 
remaining large unfragmented landscapes 
where opportunities exist to secure protected 
areas where there are currently fewer 
competing land and resource uses. These 
areas should be secured before opportunities 
are lost. 
Incorporate issues of opportunity cost: A key 
issue is that some areas may be very 
expensive for protected area expansion or 
difficult to secure, and can absorb a great deal 
of the protected area expansion effort for not 
much gain in terms of contributing to 
biodiversity targets. The balance between 
securing critical or irreplaceable sites and 
other sites that may contribute more 
effectively to meeting targets should be 
carefully considered. In some cases, it may be 
better to secure these difficult areas through 
other conservation mechanisms such as 
development controls or zoning. 
Other operational and economic issues:
Protected areas need to be manageable, so 
operational issues need to be taken into 
account. Similarly, protected areas should 
contribute to the national, regional and local 
economy especially through tourism. These 
are all legitimate reasons for prioritising 
particular areas for expansion. However, care 
must be taken to ensure that these issues do 
not override all the above core principles 
aimed at securing a representative, 
ecologically sustainable and efficient reserve 
network. 
Overall, protected area agencies should aim 
for a balanced portfolio of expansion activities 
which contribute to biodiversity conservation 
and ecological sustainability. They should 
avoid reinforcing existing biases in the 
protected area network by not protecting 
more of the same. Priorities should be clearly 
defined through a robust systematic planning 
process. 
Priority areas for protected area 
expansion 
The NPAES 2016 has collated protected area 
expansion priorities from the provincial and 
national agencies. These priorities reflect the 
spatial priorities from provincial and other 
PAES, or alternatively show the areas that are 
currently being incorporated into these 
provincial and agency strategies. Priorities 
were obtained from, and confirmed with, the 
various agencies and provinces. 
Protected areas agencies should aim for a 
balanced portfolio of expansion activities, 
which contribute to biodiversity 
conservation and ecological sustainability. 
They should avoid reinforcing existing 
biases by not protecting more of the same. 
Priorities should be clearly defined through 
a robust systematic planning process.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 35
An overall map of current protected areas, 
areas under negotiation and collated priorities 
from provinces and agencies is shown in 
Figure 11. 
The identified priority areas cover a total area 
of 184 190km2
, in addition to areas currently 
under negotiation covering 72 584km2
 of 
mostly marine areas. For comparison, the 
current protected area network covers a total 
of approximately 282 479km2
, the terrestrial 
protected areas are 96 610km2
 and the Prince 
Edward Islands marine protected area is 
180 862km2
. 
The following sections detail the priority areas 
for each province and summarise them as 
follows: 
 How were the priority areas identified? 
 Where are the main priority areas? 
 What are the main biodiversity features? 
 What are the key pressures on priority 
areas for protected area expansion? 
Figure 11: Current protected areas, areas under negotiation and collated priorities from provinces and

indicated.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 36
Priority areas in the Eastern Cape 
Figure 12: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Eastern Cape. 
How were the priority areas identified? The Eastern Cape has a provincial conservation plan32, which 
had to be significantly updated when the provincial PAES was prepared33. The update included freshwater 
and estuarine priorities, climate change issues and key gaps in the representation of terrestrial ecosystems. 
The priority areas represent a finite set of implementation priorities rather than a comprehensive set of 
areas required to meet all targets. SANParks priorities were fully included into the provincial plan and hence 
were not added separately in the NPAES.
Where are the main priority areas? The main priorities are Pondoland, Qhorha-Manubi, Greater 
Baviaanskloof, Katberg-Amathole, the East London Coast, the Sunshine Coast, the St Francis region, 
Mountain Zebra to Camdeboo National Parks, around Addo National Park and the North Eastern Cape 
interior grasslands.
What are the main biodiversity features? Key biodiversity features targeted are the Pondoland Centre 
of Endemism, the high value montane grasslands and forest mosaics of the Katberg-Amathole, the wetland 
complexes of Matatiele, remaining pockets of coastal forest and grassland, corridor areas of the Sneeuberg 
region, and the under-protected and unique grasslands of the Southern Drakensberg.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Agriculture (both commercial and subsistence) is an 
issue in many of the priority areas, new forestry programs are an issue in the east, while coastal urban 
 
32 Berliner and Desmet, 2007. 
33 Skowno et al., 2012. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 37
expansion threatens coastal areas. Mining and infrastructure projects are issues in some areas such as the 
Pondoland.
Priority areas in KwaZulu-Natal 
Figure 13: Priority areas for protected area expansion in KwaZulu-Natal. 
How were the priority areas identified? Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife has a well-established and up to date 
systematic conservation planning system which identifies a comprehensive set of Critical Biodiversity Areas, 
within which protected area expansion priorities are identified34
. Key issues include targeting irreplaceable 
and under-represented biodiversity features and important landscape corridors.
Where are the main priority areas? Most irreplaceable features are in the midland and coastal regions. 
In addition, there are critical landscape linkages including the Kokstad to Port Edward, Bulwer, Nottingham
Road, Glencoe to Umtunzini, and Zululand/Maputaland corridors.
What are the main biodiversity features? Key features include the remaining areas of irreplaceable, 
highly threatened and under-represented Sub-escarpment Grassland, Sub-escarpment Savanna and Indian 
Ocean Coastal Belt. In addition, key landscape corridors are targeted. The planning process fully 
incorporates aquatic and species priorities.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Urban residential and commercial expansion in the 
coastal areas are the key pressures, while commercial and subsistence agriculture are an issue inland.

Priority areas in Mpumalanga 
Figure 14: Priority areas for protected area expansion in Mpumalanga. 
How were the priority areas identified? Mpumalanga has an up to date and comprehensive systematic 
conservation plan35, from which a subset of areas was prioritised for the provincial PAES36. The prioritisation 
focused on meeting biodiversity targets for ecosystems, species and process areas. Key issues were 
landscape connectivity and securing threatened ecosystems.
Where are the main priority areas? Although a very comprehensive set of areas have been identified, 
the key priority areas are the Loskop-Middelburg region, the Steenkampsberg, Vaalhoek (near Blyde 
Canyon), Kaapsehoop and Schoemanskloof on the escarpment, the Slaaihoek and Badplaas region and 
around Wakkerstroom.
What are the main biodiversity features? The plan focuses on key corridors, priority intact grasslands, 
unprotected threatened species, threatened ecosystems and areas with remaining wilderness 
characteristics. Most priorities are in the Mesic Highveld Grasslands.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Rapid expansion of mining (especially for coal) is the 
primary threat in the priority areas. In addition, significant pressures exist from commercial and subsistence 
arable agriculture, and to a lesser extent plantation forestry.

Priority areas in Limpopo 
Figure 15: Priority areas for protected area expansion in Limpopo 
How were the priority areas identified? The Limpopo Province has a relatively recent provincial 
systematic conservation plan37 from which a spatially specific provincial protected areas expansion strategy 
was developed38. The spatial planning already includes SANParks priority areas and hence these were not 
separately added by the NPAES.
Where are the main priority areas? High value sites which are under threat are prioritised, particularly 
the Haenertsburg-Modjadji area, the Blouberg (and adjacent Makgabeng) and the Nyslvlei (and adjacent 
Makapan) areas. Further priority areas include the Makuya region, the area around the Wolkberg and the 
Drakensberg-Strydpoortberge region. In addition, areas with high land-owner willingness (e.g. Waterberg 
and Soutpansberg), and areas with committed champions for protected area expansion (e.g. Kruger to 
Canyons Biosphere and areas in the Waterberg Biosphere) are included.
What are the main biodiversity features? The priority areas comprehensively target the full range of 
biodiversity features in the province including under-protected terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, 
landscape corridors and major areas important for threatened species.
 
37 Desmet et al., 2013. 
38 Desmet et al., 2014. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 40
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Cultivation and land degradation (often associated with 
former homeland areas) are consistent issues across many of the priority areas, while plantations and 
mining are locally very significant.
Priority areas in Gauteng 
Figure 16: Priority areas for protected area expansion in Gauteng. 
How were the priority areas identified? Gauteng province has a clearly delineated set of spatial 
priorities derived from its provincial systematic conservation plan. The Gauteng Protected Areas Expansion 
Strategy comprehensively includes the Critical Biodiversity Areas from the Gauteng C-Plan Version 3.339
Where are the main priority areas? Key priority areas include the areas in and around the Cradle of 
Humankind in the West Rand, the Mesic Highveld Grasslands around Bronkhorstspruit, the Central Bushveld 
areas around Hammanskraal in the north of the province, and key connection across the south of the 
province linking Suikerbosrand and Sebokeng. Very few options remain in and around the highly urbanised 
City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan areas.
What are the main biodiversity features? The full range of important biodiversity features are targeted, 
including remain areas of threatened ecosystems, irreplaceable and important features. The priorities also 
include wetlands, rivers and their buffers, important ridges, dolomite areas and climate change corridors.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? The key pressure is the expansion of urban areas for a 
range of residential, commercial and industrial reasons. Mining is also an important pressure, though less so 
 
39 GDARD, 2014. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 41
than urban pressures. Arable commercial agriculture and subsistence agriculture are important in particular 
areas such as the far north.
Priority areas in the North West 
Figure 17: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the North West. 
How were the priority areas identified? The North West is currently completing an update on its 
provincial conservation plan. Critical Biodiversity Areas from this plan, in particular priority areas (i.e. 
corridors and priority conservation nodes), were selected as the spatial priorities based on discussion with 
the conservation planners and provincial officials. These areas will be formalised into the revised provincial 
PAES.
Where are the main priority areas? The major spatial priorities areas are the Platinum Heritage Park in 
the north east of the province, the Highveld Park (around Potchefstroom to Boskop Dam Nature Reserve), 
the areas around the lower Vaal near SA Lombaard and Bloemhof Dam, Taung, Molemane to Mariko, and 
the Molopo area. In addition, some important finer scale corridors are prioritised through the few 
remaining intact linkages in the centre of the province.
What are the main biodiversity features? Under-protected ecosystem types, particularly in the Central 
Bushveld, Arid Highveld Grasslands and Eastern Kalahari Bushveld ecosystems are important biodiversity 
features. There is a strong focus on improving the landscape connectivity between reserves, with a 
particular focus on the major connections in the Bushveld areas of the Platinum Heritage Park and the more 
tenuous remaining river corridors through the Arid Highveld Grasslands.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 42
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Commercial dryland agriculture (especially focused on 
maize production) is by far the dominant pressure in the province, though mining pressures and subsistence 
farming are an issue in the north east.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 43
Priority areas in the Free State 
Figure 18: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Free State. 
How were the priority areas identified? The Free State is about to finalise its provincial conservation 
plan and protected areas expansion strategy. The plans are robust and systematic, with a clear focus on 
improving the representation of under-protected ecosystems. Initial priority areas from the draft provincial 
PAES were combined with SANParks expansion areas.
Where are the main priority areas? Three main geographic themes can be seen. The plan includes a 
large area of Mesic Highveld Grasslands and Drakensberg Grasslands in the eastern Free State which are 
important for ecosystem service delivery. There is a central and southern band of priority areas targeting 
very under-protected Dry Highveld Grasslands, and then a smaller set of areas in the west targeting the 
upper Nama-Karoo and Eastern Kalahari Bushveld.
What are the main biodiversity features? The plan strongly targets threatened and under-protected 
terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in the grasslands. The remaining intact areas of Endangered and 
Vulnerable ecosystem types are included in the plan. Freshwater priorities (i.e. FEPA40 rivers and wetlands) 
are less directly targeted but are nevertheless built into the overall spatial planning process.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? The greatest pressure on Free State priority areas is 
agriculture. Most of this is commercial maize and sunflower production, though in some areas subsistence 
agriculture is also an issue. Large dams have also had an impact in the past.

Priority areas in the Western Cape 
Figure 19: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Western Cape. 
How were the priority areas identified? CapeNature has a well-established and up to date systematic 
conservation planning system, which is used to identify Critical Biodiversity areas at a fine scale. Priorities 
from this planning process were put through a filter based on biodiversity features and operational 
requirements to identify a subset of priority areas for protected area expansion that are included in their 
PAES. SANParks priorities around existing national parks were also included.
Where are the main priority areas? The priority areas are widely distributed across the province. Key 
spatial priorities focus on remaining sites in threatened and under-protected lowland Fynbos systems, 
important climate change adaptation corridors, and consolidating areas around and between key reserves. 
The main geographical gap in the network is that the Nama-Karoo was largely excluded as it was of lower 
priority, but this is now changing with the emergence of shale gas exploration.
What are the main biodiversity features? The plan targets key gaps in the protected area network. It 
aims to secure at least one ‘best remaining’ site in each of the province’s most poorly-protected Critically 
Endangered ecosystems, secure key sites for important species, secure special (unique, under-protected & 
threatened) freshwater ecosystems in each region and also targets marine, estuarine and coastal features.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Lowland areas are under extreme pressure from urban 
and agricultural expansion. Agricultural expansion issues include expansion of potatoes, olives, rooibos and 
vineyards. Importantly, unmanaged Fynbos areas can be rapidly degraded through invasion by alien 
vegetation and poor fire management.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 45
Priority areas in the Northern Cape 
Figure 20: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Northern Cape. 
How were the priority areas identified? The Northern Cape now has a full Protected Area Expansion 
Strategy41 developed by the Northern Cape Department of Environment and Nature Conservation with 
support from the Department of Environmental Affairs. This is based on an up to date systematic 
conservation plan for the province42
. The PAES priorities, which are used directly, are largely a subset of the 
Critical Biodiversity Areas from the systematic conservation plan that were identified on implementation 
priority. SANParks priorities were fully included into the provincial PAES. 
Where are the main priority areas? The priority areas are in the Succulent Karoo areas of the Namakwa 
District, Bushmanland, the southern Nama-Karoo as well as in the expansion areas of the existing national 
parks in the province.
What are the main biodiversity features? Succulent Karoo and southern Nama-Karoo priorities, as well 
as river and wetlands are included. Arid Savanna and some Desert ecosystems are currently not fully
included in these of priorities, and these will need to be focussed on after existing priorities have been 
implemented.
 
41 Balfour and Holness, 2017.
42 Holness and Oosthuysen, 2016.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 46
What are the key pressures on priority areas? Areas of Bushmanland and Namakwa are under 
pressure from mining and rapid expansion of renewable energy facilities. Priorities along the Gariep River 
are under threat from expansion of irrigated agriculture. Climate change impacts are likely to be very 
significant in this region.
Priority areas in marine ecosystems 
Figure 21: Priority areas for protected area expansion for marine ecosystems. These currently consist of 
areas under negotiation as part of Operation Phakisa and some other pending MPA declarations. 
How were the priority areas identified? These are current areas under negotiation for Phase 1 of 
Operation Phakisa, which aims to proclaim a representative network of MPAs that protects at least 5% of 
mainland South Africa’s EEZ. The systematically identified priorities were based on assessments for the 
Offshore Marine Protected Area Project 201143, the West Coast of South Africa44 and assessments 
associated with the NBA 201145. Further priorities to take the total to 10% will be identified by 2018.
Where are the main priority areas? These currently consist of the offshore areas under negotiation as 
part of Operation Phakisa, as well as MPAs in Algoa Bay, Namaqua, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape.

44 Majiedt et al., 2013. 
45 Sink et al., 2012. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 47
What are the main biodiversity features? Biodiversity features include under-protected ecosystems, 
sensitive habitats, and threatened ecosystems and species, as well as key nursery, spawning and feeding 
areas.
What are the key pressures on priority areas? The current priorities were deliberately designed to 
avoid major competing activities and pressures. Nevertheless, until they are declared the priority areas will 
still be vulnerable to fishery pressures as well as oil/gas exploration and potential phosphate mining.
Looking forward: Achievements if 
the priorities are implemented 
This section looks forward to the 
achievements that could be made in terms of 
representation of ecosystems if all the areas 
currently under negotiation and the priority 
areas are added to the protected area 
network. 
Table 10 provides a summary of how the 
protection levels for all ecosystems could 
change in 20 years, if the current areas under 
negotiation and the identified priority areas 
are implemented. If we assume that these 
areas are secured, the level of representation 
of South Africa’s ecosystems will be 
significantly improved.

Should the priorities be implemented, of the 
969 distinct ecosystem types, 506 or 52% 
(compared to the current 201 or 21%) will be 
Well Protected, and 169 or 17% (compared to 
the current 122 or 13%) will be Moderately 
Protected. For the lower categories of 
protection level, 184 or 19% (compared to the 
current 286 or 30%) of ecosystem types will 
be Poorly Protected, while only 110 or 11% 
(compared to the current 360 or 37%) of 
ecosystem types will remain Not Protected. 
The significant improvement in protection 
levels that is anticipated is evident in Figure 
22, which can be compared with the current 
situation shown in Figure 6. 
Under this scenario, an additional 305 
ecosystem types would move to the Well 
Protected category, while 232 types improve 
in protection level by at least one category. A 
further 128 types would show some increase 
in protected area coverage but not enough to 
result in a category change. Based on the 
priority areas, greatest progress is anticipated 
in the Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna, 
wetlands, rivers and offshore benthic and 
pelagic ecosystems. 
It is important to note that the full extent of 
priority areas is unlikely to be implemented, 
as these areas will generally include more of 
an ecosystem than is required to meet 
targets. Some priority areas may include fine 
scale sites not suitable for inclusion into a 
protected area. In addition, when detailed 
planning takes place, the final implementation 
footprint may extend beyond the priority 
area. This is to be expected, and is an 
inevitable consequence of planning occurring 
at a broader scale than final implementation. 
Priority area boundaries should never be 
literally interpreted as future protected area 
boundaries. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 49
Figure 22: Anticipated protection levels for ecosystems in 20 years should all the priority areas be 
successfully implemented.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 50
Remaining gaps and revisions of 
spatial plans 
Implementing the current areas under 
negotiation and priority areas would not 
improve the situation for 87 ecosystem types. 
Approximately half of the ecosystems that 
show no improvement are terrestrial, a 
quarter are rivers and the remaining types are 
spread between the other biozones (Figure 
22). 
It is important not to interpret the gap 
between what can be delivered by securing 
the spatial priorities and the requirements for 
fully meeting targets, as reflecting poor or 
incomplete planning. Different provinces and 
agencies have used slightly different, but 
equally valid, planning approaches. This 
results in some agencies placing a smaller 
basket of immediate priorities into the priority 
areas, while others prefer to put a far broader 
set of areas on the table. This is clearly 
illustrated by the contrast between the 
Western Cape, where a very specific set of 
priority sites which are a small subset of their 
Critical Biodiversity Areas has been identified 
and the Free State where the priority areas 
essentially include the entire set of Critical 
Biodiversity Areas from the provincial 
conservation plan. These approaches are 
different, but each have their advantages. 
In the case of marine priorities, the gap 
between what is delivered by the current set 
of priorities (which have now moved into the 
‘negotiated’ category as they have been 
gazetted) and the full area required to meet 
targets reflects an ongoing political process. It 
has been agreed that an additional set of 
priorities will be identified once the first set of 
Operation Phakisa priorities have been 
declared. 
In time, it will be necessary to repeat the 
provincial and agency protected area 
expansion planning processes. This is 
necessary as implementation of protected 
area expansion programmes will result in the 
priority areas needing to be revised. In 
general, it should be sufficient to revise these 
plans every five years, but if significant 
progress is made in a region, then more 
frequent updates may be required. In 
particular, it will be necessary to identify a 
second set of marine priorities once the initial 
Operation Phakisa priorities have been 
implemented. Where a number of agencies 
are active in a province (e.g. a provincial 
conservation agency and SANParks), it is 
particularly important that protected area 
plans are well-aligned.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 51
6. Mechanisms for protected area expansion
There are three main mechanisms for expanding the land-based protected area network:
Acquisition of land is the traditional way of establishing and expanding protected areas, but involves 
large upfront costs.
Contract agreements are agreements in which landowners maintain ownership of their land but 
enter into a contract with a protected area agency. They are facilitated by provisions in the 
Protected Areas Act. They are being used increasingly as part of biodiversity stewardship 
programmes. Contract agreements are attractive because they tend to cost protected area agencies 
less than acquisition, and because by far the largest proportion of land in the priority areas is in 
private hands. Biodiversity stewardship programmes are increasingly recognized as an important 
mechanism in the expansion of the protected area network. There are significant potential synergies 
between biodiversity stewardship programmes, land reform and rural development.
Declaration of public or state land involves reassigning land to a protected area agency from 
another organ of state. It has limited applicability because only a small proportion of land in the 
priority areas for protected area expansion is public land.
Expansion of the marine protected area network is more complex and mechanisms for securing 
protected areas specifically focused on inland aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood.
Once priority areas for protected area 
expansion have been identified, it is necessary 
to look at mechanisms for expanding the 
protected area network in those priority 
areas. There are three main mechanisms for 
expanding existing land-based protected 
areas or establishing new ones: 
 Acquisition of land 
 Contract agreements, including through 
biodiversity stewardship programmes 
 Declaration of state or public land 
Expansion of the marine protected area 
network is more complex. Marine protected 
areas are declared in terms of the Protected 
Areas Act as amended in June 2014. For 
offshore marine protected areas no private 
property rights are involved but there are 
mining rights, medium- and long-term fishing 
rights with annual quotas, and rights of access 
at sea that have to be modified, rescinded or 
expropriated in order to establish a marine 
protected area. Mechanisms for achieving this 
have been developed and are being 
implemented under Operation Phakisa. 
Mechanisms for securing protected areas 
specifically focused on inland aquatic 
ecosystems are poorly understood. The 
current process of securing rivers, wetlands 
and estuaries using the methods used for 
terrestrial ecosystems has proved largely 
ineffective, as even when the features are 
fully incorporated into protected areas, they 
are still subject to catchment related impacts. 
Much work remains to understand how to 
properly secure inland aquatic ecosystems 
and their associated processes. 
The focus in this chapter is on mechanisms for 
expanding the land-based protected area 
network. Contract agreements are 
increasingly used, and provincial biodiversity National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 52
stewardship programmes have been 
strengthened and rolled out to all provinces. 
Nevertheless, acquisition of land and 
declaration of public land remain appropriate 
and important mechanisms for protected area 
expansion in some circumstances. Each of the 
three mechanisms is discussed briefly below. 
Acquisition of land 
Acquisition of land through purchase is the 
traditional mechanism for expanding the 
protected area network. Land is bought by 
protected area agencies, either for inclusion 
in existing protected areas or to establish a 
new protected area. Acquisition is the most 
secure option for protected area expansion, 
but also usually the costliest option. 
Because acquisition is the mechanism that has 
been used most in the establishment of the 
land-based protected area network to date, it 
would be easy to continue to rely on it as the 
primary mechanism for expanding the 
protected area network. However, it will not 
be possible to meet protected area targets 
using acquisition alone – the cost would 
simply be too great. 
Contract agreements, including 
biodiversity stewardship 
Contractual arrangements for expanding 
national parks were made possible by the 
National Parks Act (Act 57 of 1976) and have 
been used by SANParks especially from the 
late 1980s onwards. The Protected Areas Act 
has made it possible for contract agreements 
to be used in a wider range of contexts since 
2003, including by provincial protected area 
agencies. In this mechanism, the land 
concerned remains in private hands with a 
formal contract between the landowner and a 
protected area agency. The landowner agrees 
to restrictions on use of the land and the 
protected area agency commits to various 
forms of management assistance. In the most 
secure cases, restrictions on use of the land 
are written into the title deed and thus 
remain in place if the land changes hands. The 
landowner of such a contractual protected 
area is eligible for exclusion from property 
rates in terms of the Municipal Property Rates 
Act (Act 6 of 2004). 
Contract agreements in terms of the 
Protected Areas Act are the most secure of a 
series of options for agreements with 
landowners that form part of biodiversity 
stewardship programmes. The less secure 
options require fewer restrictions on the part 
of landowners and come with less ongoing 
management assistance from the protected 
area agency. They are also not recognised in 
terms of the Protected Areas Act and thus do 
not constitute formal protected areas. These 
informal conservation areas can be useful as 
‘entry-level’ biodiversity stewardship 
agreements, and may lead over time to more 
secure contract agreements. Existing 
conservation areas can also provide a useful 
starting point for pursuing contract 
agreements, as long as they fall within 
important areas for protected area expansion. 
Following on from the pioneering work of 
CapeNature, all provincial protected area 
agencies now have a functional biodiversity 
stewardship programme. The national 
biodiversity stewardship policy document is in 
an advanced stage of development and is 
intended for publication during this phase of 
implementation (see Chapter 8). More detail

on biodiversity stewardship is available in the 
Biodiversity Stewardship Guideline 
Document47
. 
It is important to note that contract 
agreements can be used where land is under 
communal ownership. As discussed in 
Chapter 2, the Richtersveld National Park, the 
Makuleke section of Kruger National Park and 
iSimangaliso Wetland Park provide good 
examples of community ownership of formal 
protected areas through contract agreements. 
Several biodiversity stewardship agreements 
are in negotiation with communities in other 
parts of the country. There are significant 
potential synergies between land reform, 
contract agreements for protected areas, and 
biodiversity stewardship programmes. 
Contractual protected areas can involve 
substantial costs in the process of negotiating 
the contract, and require ongoing resources 
from the protected area agency to support 
the landowner in managing and auditing the 
management of the property concerned. 
Nevertheless, the overall cost of contractual 
protected areas tends to be substantially less 
than the cost of acquisition. Thus, so long as 
there is adequate budget to cover the actual 
costs of contractual protected areas, they 
remain an attractive mechanism for protected

area expansion in many circumstances, 
especially where land prices are prohibitive. 
Protected area agencies should develop a 
basket of incentives that can be offered to 
landowners in return for entering into 
contract agreements, over and above the 
existing exclusion from municipal property 
rates and the income tax incentives that 
support the establishment of contractual 
protected areas (see Chapter 7). Additional 
incentives that can be combined to suit 
landowner preferences include, for example, 
technical and professional planning and 
operations support, fire management 
services, assistance with clearing invasive 
alien plants, advice on sustainable harvesting 
of natural resources, partnerships in naturebased commercial ventures, access to 
marketing resources, access to expensive 
game, fencing supply, and enforcement 
support. 
Declaration of public or state land 
Declaration of public or state land involves 
reassigning the management of public or state 
land from a national or provincial government 
department to a protected area agency. 
Where land in priority areas for protected 
area expansion is held by the state (for 
example, the Department of Public Works, 
DAFF, South African National Defence Force) 
or by parastatal agencies (for example, 
ESKOM), this should be identified and where 
possible management of the land should be 
assigned to a protected area agency. 
It is worth noting that this mechanism has 
limited usefulness as a very small proportion 
(approximately 4%) of land in the protected 
area expansion priority areas is held by the 
state. However, where it is possible to use this 
mechanism it may be very cost effective
Contract agreements involve formal 
contracts between landowners and 
protected area agencies, in which the 
landowner agrees to restrictions on the use 
of the land and the protected area agency 
commits to various forms of management 
assistance. Contract agreements are often 
much more cost effective than acquisition 
of land and are used increasingly as part of 
biodiversity stewardship programmes.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 54
7. Financing protected area expansion
Protected area institutions can draw on several sources of funding for, and adopt more costeffective approaches to, the expansion of protected areas. All funding sources will have an 
important role to play, given the size of the task of achieving the ambitious protected area targets.
The following complementary financing mechanisms and implementation approaches should be 
considered: funding from the national treasury; income from the use of protected areas; private 
voluntary donations; official donor assistance; biodiversity stewardship and biodiversity offsets.
The business case for a national conservation trust fund, with protected area institutions as the 
principal beneficiaries, needs to be investigated. This conservation trust fund could, through the 
investment of its capital, generate more stable and predictable income flows to finance protected 
area expansion and management efforts.
The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN), currently being piloted in South Africa, is intended to
develop a more comprehensive national resource mobilisation strategy for biodiversity conservation 
and mainstreaming efforts across the country, and to improve cost-effectiveness. The outcomes 
from the BIOFIN project will therefore be extremely relevant to the ongoing pursuit of sustainable 
financing strategies for protected area expansion.
The Sustainable Financing Framework for 
Management Authorities of State Managed 
Protected Areas48 highlights that all protected 
area institutions cite inadequate funding as a 
significant constraint to their ability to meet 
their targets for management effectiveness 
and protected area expansion. With slowing 
economic growth, and the rising costs of 
servicing debt, the current levels of national 
and provincial budget allocations to protected 
area institutions from the national fiscus are 
not likely to increase significantly. There is a 
need to further develop and diversify the 
sources of income to finance the ongoing 
costs of protected area expansion, and to 
continually improve the ability of protected 
area institutions to more cost-effectively 
administer the growing protected area estate.

Protected area institutions can draw on

protected area targets.
Funding is a significant constraint to the 
ability of protected area agencies to meet 
their targets for management effectiveness 
and protected area expansion. There is a 
need to develop and diversify the sources 
of funding to finance the ongoing costs of 
protected area expansion.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 55
The following complementary financing 
mechanisms and implementation approaches 
should be considered: 
Funding from the National Treasury: Core 
public sector funding mechanisms for 
protected area expansion may include budget 
allocations, conditional grants, Expanded 
Public Works Programme (EPWP) funds49
, and 
grants from the Green Fund50. In order to 
maintain and expand on current levels of 
funding from the national treasury, protected 
area institutions will need to demonstrate 
more effectively the social and economic 
benefits of public investments in protected 
area expansion. 
Income from the use of protected areas:
Increasing the income from direct access to, 
and use of resources in, protected areas –
including tourism charges, resource use fees, 
payment for ecosystem services, and bioprospecting charges – may better enable 
protected area institutions to cross-subsidise 
the activities associated with the ongoing 
expansion of the protected area estate. 
Private voluntary donations: Private sources 
of funding – including business and 
philanthropic foundations, non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs), conservation trust 
funds and private individuals – are an 
increasingly important source of financing for 
protected area expansion. There is a growing 
trend of close collaboration and pooling of 
resources between protected area agencies, 
the private sector and NGOs. Notably, this 
often occurs when linked to the socio-
 
49 Through the Natural Resource Management 
programmes and Environmental Protection and 
Infrastructure Programme. Some of this funding is 
likely to be restricted to initial implementation 
costs associated with protected area expansion 
(e.g. fencing and management infrastructure) 
rather than land costs. 
50 Funding from EPWP and the Green Fund may be 
used as an incentive for the negotiation of 
economic development of rural communities 
living in and around protected areas. 
Official donor assistance: While donor 
investments are typically short- to mediumterm and catalytic in nature, bilateral and 
multilateral donor agencies may provide 
financial and technical support to land 
acquisition and contractual negotiations with 
private and communal landowners. The 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the 
Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) 
are particularly important sources of funding 
that can be mobilised for supporting 
protected area expansion efforts. 
Biodiversity stewardship (contractual 
agreements): Biodiversity stewardship 
programmes represent a cost-effective 
strategy for expanding the protected area 
estate while avoiding the need for land 
purchases. 
In order to make biodiversity stewardship 
more effective, a number of incentives can be 
used to support landowners and communities 
entering into contractual agreements. These 
include: 
 Fiscal incentives – economic incentives 
based on government revenue or 
expenditure51
 Technical and professional advice and 
support 
 Management assistance and support 
 Partnerships in nature-based commercial 
ventures 
 Access to marketing resources 
contractual agreements or as a source of 
government co-financing for donor funds. 
51 For example, recent amendments to the 
Taxation Laws (March 2015) specifically deal with 
tax incentives for landowners who have entered 
into a contractual agreement to declare their land 
as a protected area. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 56
 Public recognition 
Biodiversity offsets52: South Africa has 
already implemented a number of biodiversity 
offsets projects and the DEA, along with some 
provinces, are in the process of developing 
guidelines for environmental offsets. 
Biodiversity offsets hold the potential to shift 
some of the burden for financing the 
expansion of protected areas from the 
national fiscus to the private sector. 
Biodiversity offsets provide a mechanism to 
compensate for residual negative impacts on 
biodiversity after all feasible and reasonable 
alternatives have been considered during the 
planning of a proposed development. The 
biodiversity offset mechanism enables land 
that was not previously designated as a 
protected area to be declared and for the 
management costs to be secured. 
Priority areas for protected area expansion 
should be the major receiving sites for offsets, 
rather than ad hoc and individually identified 
sites. Careful planning will be necessary to 
ensure that offsets are efficiently 
implemented, that they contribute optimally 
to protected area expansion and 
management, and do not place an undue 
burden on protected area agencies. A key 
issue is securing ongoing management costs. 
National conservation trust fund: The 
business case for a national conservation trust 
fund, with protected area institutions as the 
principal beneficiaries, needs to be 
investigated as a means of centralising the 
function of attracting grants and donations 
from bilateral and multilateral development 
agencies and private donors. This 
conservation trust fund could generate, 
 
52 Biodiversity offsets are intended to address the 
residual environmental impacts of development 
that cannot be avoided or effectively mitigated, 
with the intention of ensuring that the net impact

and predictable income flows to finance 
protected area expansion and management 
programmes. 
The Biodiversity Finance Initiative 
The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN), 
managed by the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the 
European Commission and the Governments 
of Germany and Switzerland, is in the process 
of being piloted in South Africa (amongst 29 
other countries) under the auspices of the 
DEA. BIOFIN is intended to provide a 
comprehensive analysis of the funding gap for 
the local implementation of the CBD’s Aichi 
biodiversity targets – including the expansion 
of protected areas – and should provide much 
needed perspective on this issue. BIOFIN also 
aims to develop a comprehensive national 
resource mobilisation strategy, and improve 
cost effectiveness through the mainstreaming 
of biodiversity into national development and 
sector planning. The outcomes from the 
BIOFIN project will therefore be extremely 
pertinent to the ongoing pursuit of 
sustainable financing strategies by protected 
area institutions.

8. Implementation of the NPAES
Protected area agencies, including provincial conservation authorities, SANParks, DAFF and DEA, are 
the primary implementers of the NPAES. Most of these agencies have developed their own PAES and 
implementation plans, which are increasingly better aligned with the NPAES targets and priority
areas.
DEA (through Working Group 1 of MINMEC) will work to ensure better alignment of the efforts of 
the multiple agencies involved in protected area expansion, will provide a forum for discussing 
challenges and sharing lessons, and track progress towards meeting protected area targets.
A detailed 5-year action plan with annual implementation targets, derived from the provincial plans, 
has been developed and is presented in this chapter.
Who implements the NPAES? 
Protected area agencies are the primary 
implementers of the NPAES. These include the 
provincial conservation authorities (agencies 
and government departments), SANParks, 
and the Oceans and Coasts Branch of DEA. 
The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (DAFF) manages protected areas 
under the National Forest Act rather than the 
Protected Areas Act. Thus, although forest 
reserves contribute to the national efforts to 
expand protected areas, they do not fall 
under the same reporting and accountability 
regimes. Protected area agencies are 
supported in their implementation of the 
NPAES by a range of organisations including 
DEA, the South African National Biodiversity 
Institute (SANBI), National Treasury, provincial 
environment departments and conservation 
NGOs. 
Many protected area agencies have 
developed, and are implementing, their own 
agency-specific protected area expansion 
strategies (PAES). The NPAES and these 
agency-specific PAESs need to be closely 
aligned to ensure that the national targets are 
met through the collective efforts of the 
individual protected area agencies. 
With multiple agencies implementing 
protected area expansion, it is also necessary 
to ensure a level of co-ordination in 
monitoring and reporting on the 
implementation of the strategy. Working 
Group 1 of MINMEC, is convened by DEA with 
representation from protected area agencies, 
SANBI, and relevant national NGOs, and is 
ideally suited to play a key role in this respect. 
This will ensure that there is alignment of the 
efforts of the multiple agencies involved in 
protected area expansion, will provide a 
forum for discussing challenges and sharing 
lessons, and track annual progress towards 
meeting protected area expansion targets. 
Protected area agencies are the primary 
implementers of the NPAES. These include 
provincial conservation authorities 
(agencies and government departments), 
SANParks, DAFF and the Oceans and Coasts 
Branch of DEA.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 58
Phased implementation of the 
NPAES 
The NPAES presents a long-term, 20-year and 
5-year strategy for the expansion of protected 
areas in South Africa. The quantification of the 
spatial targets for individual ecosystems, and 
the identification of the priority areas for 
meeting these long-term, 20-year and 5-year 
targets, are fully described in Chapter 4 and 
Chapter 5 respectively. 
The implementation of the NPAES is guided by 
5-year targets. The implementation of the 20-
year strategy for protected area expansion is 
thus structured into four implementation 
phases. 
Phase 1 of the implementation of the NPAES, 
– covering the period 2008 – 2014, has now 
been completed and a brief review of the 
progress made in protected area expansion is 
described in Chapter 3. 
Action plan for phase 2 of the 
NPAES implementation 
The implementation plan presented here 
covers the second phase (2016 – 2020) of the 
20-year strategy of the NPAES53
. At the 
national level, the priority activities and 
targets required to “support and align the 
efforts of protected area agencies in the 
ongoing expansion of protected areas, and 
track progress towards meeting long-term 
protected area system targets” have been 
collated into a 5-year action plan. The action 
plan is presented in Table 11. 
While the NPAES sets national level targets, 
the action plan does not deal with the 
detailed planning and implementation for

convened by DEA and to which representatives of 
all protected area agencies were invited. 
expanding protected areas at the provincial 
and local levels. This level of planning and 
implementation is most appropriately done by 
the responsible protected area agencies, using 
the NPAES as an overarching framework to 
guide local actions. Each protected area 
institution should continue to update, align 
and implement their institution-based PAESs 
to ensure that they will collectively contribute 
to meeting the national short- and mediumterm targets contained in the NPAES. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 59

9. Information gaps, research priorities and legislative reform priorities
Key information gaps for the NPAES include the ongoing development of an accurate spatial layer of 
existing protected areas and a national spatial data layer on land ownership and tenure. This chapter 
details a number of research priorities that would help to fill information gaps. Research priorities 
include further exploration of the role of protected areas in supporting ecosystem-based adaptation 
to climate change. Ecologically meaningful biodiversity targets for aquatic ecosystems need to be 
developed. Exploration of innovative ways to consider land price and opportunity costs in the 
identification of priority areas for protected area expansion are needed, as well as investigation of 
the likely costs of different mechanisms for protected area expansion into the future. Also useful 
would be additional research into the relative income and job creation potential of regular 
agriculture compared with protected areas and ecotourism. Finally, pilot projects are needed to 
evaluate the ways in which biodiversity stewardship agreements can used to support land reform 
and rural development.
Several information gaps, research needs and 
legislative reform priorities were adequately 
addressed during the implementation of 
phase 1 of the NPAES. 
Outstanding information gaps that need to be 
addressed include: 
 Continual updating and improving spatial 
information on the distribution of 
protected areas in the Protected Area 
Register. This includes verifying protected 
area boundaries, their proclamation 
status and management effectiveness. In 
particular, the privately owned protected 
areas included in the Protected Area 
Register but declared under pre-Protected 
Area Act legislation need to be verified. 
 The potential inclusion of areas protected 
by ‘other effective area-based measures’
should be evaluated and potentially 
included in the assessment of target 
achievement. Robust criteria need to be 
set up to ensure that only intact, wellmanaged areas with long-term security of 
biodiversity are included. 
 New biodiversity data is routinely being 
collected but does not always find its way 
into the planning data sets. More 
streamlined mechanisms for the inclusion 
of new biodiversity distribution data into 
the planning data sets are required. 
 Mapping and classification of specific 
marine ecosystems at a finer scale is 
necessary, especially for vulnerable 
marine habitats e.g. reefs, sponge beds 
and kelp forests. 
 Mapping marine ecological processes, for 
example spawning and nursery grounds 
and foraging areas for marine species. 
 The identification of remaining focus 
areas (after implementation of Phase 1 of 
Operation Phakisa) required to meet 
marine targets is a priority. 
 The specific biodiversity offset receiving 
areas which will optimally contribute to 
protected area expansion need to be 
identified and agreed on. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 65
Outstanding research priorities that still need 
to be addressed include: 
 Further exploration of the role of 
protected areas in supporting ecosystembased adaptation to climate change. 
 Research on ecologically meaningful 
biodiversity targets for marine, estuarine 
and freshwater ecosystems. 
 Innovative ways to consider land price 
and opportunity costs in the identification 
of priority areas for protected area 
expansion. 
 Strategic use of biodiversity offsets to 
expand the protected area network and 
secure its ongoing management costs 
needs to be investigated. 
Outstanding legislative reform priorities 
include: 
 A need to properly secure the legal status 
and management of mountain catchment 
areas. These were declared in terms of 
the Mountain Catchment Areas Act, which 
was forestry legislation at that stage 
falling under the DEA. There is no 
consensus on the administration of the 
Mountain Catchment Areas Act and the 
responsible regulating authority for 
mountain catchment areas. This is an 
important matter to resolve given the 
significant contribution that mountain 
catchment areas make to protected area 
targets and the vital role they play in 
providing ecosystem services. 
 A need to explore legal and institutional 
mechanisms for implementing freshwater 
conservation areas. This will include 
potential links between the Biodiversity 
Act and mechanisms provided by the 
National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998), the 
National Water Resource Strategy and the 
National Water Resource Classification 
System. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 66

Appendix 2: Supporting technical notes
This appendix provides more detailed background information beyond what could be included in the 
main document. The key sections covered in the appendix are: 
 Technical Note 1: More detailed information on the approach and principles used to set targets. 
 Technical Note 2: The detailed method for calculating targets. 
 Technical Note 3: Supporting information on the creation of the integrated ecosystem map. 
 Technical Note 4: Supporting information on the creation of the integrated ecosystem condition 
map. 
Technical Note 1: Protected area targets 
Protected area targets are action targets that indicate how much of each ecosystem should be 
included in protected areas, thus guiding protected area expansion to focus on ecosystems that are 
least protected. Internationally, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to which South Africa is 
a signatory, commits governments to a range of targets generally known as Aichi biodiversity 
targets. Target 11 states that “by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 
per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and 
ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically 
representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based 
conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes”. The key issues to 
highlight are that the CBD is very specific about the network needing to be ecologically 
representative and that the targets need to be met by intact habitat that is ecologically functional 
and is conserved in protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. Further, 
the flat targets of 17% and 10% are relatively arbitrary, and are politically decided rather than based 
on ecologically rationale. 
South Africa has a well-established system of systematic biodiversity planning which uses 
biodiversity targets to determine which areas of the landscape and seascape are most important 
for conserving a representative sample of biodiversity pattern (ecosystems and species) and for 
keeping key ecological processes intact. These targets are used as the basis for national monitoring 
of Ecosystem Threat Status and Protection Levels in the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA)59
. 
The system, and specific values, of thresholds set out in the NBA is widely used and well-accepted 
across South Africa. These thresholds are widely used in national systematic biodiversity planning 
processes such as the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas Assessment (NFEPA)60
, 
prioritization for marine protected areas in projects such as the Offshore Marine Protected Area 
(OMPA) Project 201161, and the National Estuary Biodiversity Plan for South Africa 201262. The same 
ecosystem targets are used in provincial conservation plans. Biodiversity targets for terrestrial 
ecosystems in South Africa range from 16% to 36% of the original extent of each ecosystem, with 
 
59 The targets are often called biodiversity thresholds. See Driver et al. 2012 for explanations of the thresholds, 
the systematic conservation planning approach used in South Africa and details on the biodiversity targets, how 
they are determined, and how they are used in the evaluations of ecosystem protection level. 
60 Nel et al. 2011 
61 Sink et al. 2011. 
62 Turpie et al. 2012. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 103 
higher thresholds for more variable and species-rich ecosystems. In the absence of better data, a 
20% biodiversity threshold is used for marine, river, wetland and estuarine systems. 
The NPAES 2008 set long-term protected area targets equal to the biodiversity targets, so that 
protected area targets would have an underlying science-basis reflecting the ecological 
requirements for protecting ecosystems effectively. The long-term goal was to incorporate into the 
protected area network at least that proportion of each ecosystem required to meet its biodiversity 
target. For the 20-year target, the biodiversity targets for individual ecosystems were adjusted so 
that they would cumulatively add up to the CBD target, which was 12% at that time for terrestrial 
areas. Specific habitat based protected area targets were set for each terrestrial habitat. More 
general targets, that were not habitat based, were set for marine (20% of which 15% should be notake zones) and coastal systems (25% of the coast length of which 15% should be no-take zones). 
Although the need for these targets was emphasised in the NPAES 2008, no specific targets could be 
set for rivers, wetlands or estuaries, as suitable habitat maps were not yet available. 
There are a number of issues relevant to protected area targets that have emerged since the NPAES 
2008: 
 The international CBD targets have increased to 17% of terrestrial and inland water, and 10% of 
coastal and marine areas, and the timelines have been adjusted. Further, there is a far stronger 
emphasis on the network needing to be ecologically representative and that the targets need to 
be met by intact habitat that is ecologically functional and is conserved in protected areas and 
other effective area-based conservation measures. 
 The coast length target proved to be very difficult to monitor as the further you zoom into a 
coastline, the more detail you see and the longer the line is. Also it is important to recognize that 
natural ecosystems do not consist of a line, but rather consist of areas. 
 In addition to the maps of terrestrial ecosystem types, we have how good maps of rivers, 
wetlands, estuaries and marine ecosystems. We need to set targets for these features. 
Unfortunately, these maps were separately created, with the consequence that one can have 
different habitat types overlapping (e.g. a terrestrial ecosystem, a specific river type and a 
wetland could all be mapped at the same site). This is clearly not the case on the ground, but 
rather is an issue related to our current fragmented approach to ecosystem mapping63 . This 
means that if one just adds up the individual thresholds for these features that they will 
artificially inflate the target required 64
. 
 The terrestrial ecosystem map has been updated, with the consequence that areas of specific 
habitat types have changed. Similarly, both the wetland and marine ecosystem maps have had a 
series of spatial updates. 
 
63 An integrated habitat map is a key priority for the National Biodiversity Assessment 2018. 
64 It has been argued that this does not matter as one would just add all the features together that are found at 
a site when one is calculating protection levels. However, this could result in falsely targeting sites for protection 
where the mapped features overlap. There would clearly be no rational ecological argument for this, as in reality 
only one ecosystem is found at a site. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 104 
The NPAES has built on the principles and approach established for the NPAES 2008. The core 
elements of this approach, which we have retained, are: 
 In the long term, South Africa’s protected area targets should align with its established 
biodiversity thresholds. This ensures that, in principle, enough of each ecosystem will be 
protected to ensure that no further ecosystems can become Critically Endangered as 
sufficient intact habitat would be secured in the long term to avoid crossing this threshold. 
Further, alignment of the targets allows for consistent and aligned reporting. 
 Targets should be specifically set for each ecosystem. 
 Although overall the long term targets should meet the total CBD commitment, we optimize 
the allocation across habitats to reflect differing levels of biodiversity, i.e. we increase 
targets for diverse habitats, but reduce them in relatively low diversity habitats so that the 
overall commitment in terms of area remains the same. This ensures an optimal biodiversity 
outcome from our protected area expansion process. 
 Over a 20-year period, South Africa’s protected area targets should aim to achieve its 
commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity even if the convention’s 
timelines are not adhered to. 
 Shorter term targets are calculated as a proportion of the 20-year target i.e. the 5 year 
target is a quarter of the 20 year target. 
In addition, the following principles have been added: 
 Targets should also be set for marine, wetland, river and estuarine features at the ecosystem 
level. 
 Targets can be met only by intact habitat. This principle was established in the NPAES 2008 
but was only partially implemented as only artificial waterbodies were excluded at that time. 
 Targets can be met in protected areas and other areas with effective area-based 
conservation measures. Currently, we only evaluate protected areas, as these are the only 
areas where biodiversity is currently legally secured. In the future, once other area based 
conservation mechanisms have been secured effectively (e.g. through having intact natural 
areas of biospheres strictly zoned for conservation, subject to robust and effective land use 
controls, and have well-capacitated management authorities), it is anticipated that the intact 
and secure areas zoned for conservation under these other measures will also contribute to 
meeting targets. 
 Targets for features should not be artificially inflated by having falsely overlapping habitat 
maps. 
 The approach should be to set out clear principles for target setting, so that when habitat 
maps inevitably improve, biodiversity targets are refined (e.g. through more detailed 
biodiversity survey of aquatic habitats), or political commitments change (e.g. a revised CBD 
target), that it is a minor administrative and GIS task to recalculate the area required. A key 
element of this is that we need to move away from being fixated by the area measurement 
of target, which is in fact a secondary calculation, and rather realize that the area required is 
a function of the percentage of the habitat that is required and the mapped original extent 
of the feature. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 105 
Technical Note 2: Calculating targets 
Targets are a fundamental building block guiding the design, implementation and evaluation of any 
protected area network that aims to be fully representative of all biodiversity. As discussed in the 
main body of the NPAES and in Technical Note One, targets for each ecosystem are a function of the 
original extent of that ecosystem; the proportion of the ecosystem that needs to be conserved to 
retain all its key biodiversity pattern and process (i.e. the biodiversity target); the political, 
administrative and practical considerations of how much to expand the protected area network; and 
finally, interim targets are influenced by timelines for implementation. All of these elements are 
however subject to change. For example, additional wetlands could be mapped which changes the 
original extent, new surveys could result in better biodiversity targets being set, the Aichi 
biodiversity targets related to CBD commitments could be altered, and finally a protected area 
expansion strategy may be implemented over a longer period. Therefore, the NPAES has established 
a system that sets robust targets, but which can be quickly and easily updated when changes in any 
of the input elements occurs. Ideally, it should be a minor GIS and administrative task to recalculate 
the required target. 
The target calculation is undertaken for each ecosystem65 using the following steps: 
1. Identify the appropriate biodiversity target percentage to use for the ecosystem in question66
. 
These currently range from 16 to 36% for terrestrial ecosystems, with a 20% target used for 
other ecosystems. The appropriate biodiversity threshold for each ecosystem is published in the 
latest National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA). Should the biodiversity thresholds, as published 
in the NBA change (e.g. as a result of research which improves our knowledge of the portion of a 
specific ecosystem which needs to be kept intact to conserve all its biodiversity elements), this 
change should also be applied to the NPAES. This percentage value should be used as the longterm protected area target. Securing this area in effectively managed protected areas will in 
theory ensure that no further ecosystems will become Critically Endangered, though obviously 
this opportunity has already been lost for many systems. Aligning the values also allows for 
robust and consistent assessment, and full alignment between the NPAES and the NBA. 
2. Calculate the required area to secure the long-term protected area target. This is achieved by 
calculating the area of the ecosystem on an appropriate map, and multiplying this by the longterm protected area target percentage. 
3. Establish the relationship between the total area required to meet long term protected area 
target for all ecosystems and the total area committed to politically or administratively. To do 
this we added up all the areas required to meet long-term protected area targets and divided it 
by the total area committed to under the CBD (i.e. 17% of inland and 10% for marine 
 
65 The NPAES uses this target setting method on the integrated ecosystem map that was created for this 
project. However, if the method described above is applied to a different ecosystem map (e.g. a more detailed 
ecosystem map for a province), the overall outcome will still deliver the required total area to meet national 
targets. Hence, provinces can use their own maps, and still be confident that if this method is applied that they 
will be compatible with national requirements. Targets can even be calculated individually for ecosystem maps 
that are not integrated. The overall alignment with the NPAES will be retained so long as target achievement 
for individually mapped systems is also separately evaluated. 
66 So long as this method is applied in full, even if a province has set its own different biodiversity targets for 
ecosystem types, the final total requirement will still be compatible with the overall requirement for meeting 
national protected area targets. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 106 
ecosystems). We did the calculation separately for terrestrial and marine systems. As they are 
mixed systems with terrestrial and marine elements, we treated coastal ecosystems which have 
a land component as terrestrial. This also ensures better alignment with current planning 
initiatives. Based on current values, 50% of the long-term biodiversity target is required for all 
non-coastal marine systems, while 78.63% of the long term biodiversity target is required for all 
other ecosystems67
. 
4. Combined the long-term protected area target with the appropriate proportion from point 3 to 
calculate the 20-year protected area target. 
5. Shorter term protected area targets (e.g. a 5-year target) are calculated as a portion of the 20-
year target. 
Technical Note 3: Integrated ecosystem map
The preparation of a fully integrated ecosystem map covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, 
coastal and marine ecosystems was a key activity for the NPAES (Figure A 1). Without the map, 
accurate targets cannot be set and monitoring of achievement of targets is problematic. Although 
 
67 These percentages can be directly applied to any ecosystem and its biodiversity target on any habitat map 
for South Africa, so long as the target for that ecosystem is aligned with the target from the NBA. There is no 
need to recalculate each step if there is no change to the CBD commitment. This allows rapid calculations to be 
made in provincial PAES assessments where more refined ecosystem maps are used. 
Figure A 1: An integrated ecosystem map was created for South Africa. The map includes 969 distinct 
terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems and is mapped for the full extent 
of South African territory including its EEZ. The inset shows the Prince Edward Islands and their 
surrounding EEZ. Pelagic offshore ecosystems, which extend over the benthic offshore ecosystems 
are shown in the second insert. This is the first time an integrated ecosystem map is available for 
South Africa.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 107 
good maps of the individual ecosystem types now exist, these maps were separately created, with 
the consequence that one can have different habitat types overlapping. We therefore undertook a 
mapping process to develop an integrated map. We identified 26 biozones68 (which are similar to 
biomes but are not just applicable in terrestrial units) which include 969 distinct ecosystems. A map 
showing the biozones is provided in Figure A 2 and a summary of biozones and ecosystems is given 
in Table A 2. 
The mapping used the following building blocks: 
 Terrestrial Ecosystems: The revised 2012 National vegetation map69. There are 450 ecosystem 
types in 12 biozones. These biozones are very similar to the corresponding terrestrial biome, but 
will have a reduced area as some portions of the unit will now be mapped as wetlands or rivers. 
 Wetlands: Natural wetlands included in the 2015 revised national wetland map (4a) were 
used70. Wetlands were included at the group level, which has 136 distinct ecosystem types. 
These are all included in 1 biozone as we do not currently have a reliable basis on which to 
divide these systems. 
 Coastal and marine types: The integrated coastal and benthic ecosystem maps prepared for the 
National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 was used as the starting point71. An additional ecosystem 
was defined for all marine areas in the Southern Oceans which were not previously included in 
the national map. There are 109 benthic and coastal ecosystem types, 16 pelagic types and 1 
Southern Ocean type distributed across 9 biozones. 
 Estuaries: Estuary types were mapped based on the outlines in the National Estuary map 2012 
and the classification in Whitfield (1992). There are 46 estuary ecosystem types in 3 biozones. 
 Rivers: River ecosystems were based on the NFEPA classification and dataset (Nel et al., 2011). 
There are 126 distinct ecosystem types. As this map treats rivers as lines with no area, we 
approximated river areas by buffering rivers based on stream order, with the smallest rivers 
having a 30m buffer and largest ones 210m. 
The individual components were integrated into a single map created at a 30m resolution using a 
simple rule based approach whereby wetlands and estuaries overrode all other layers; rivers 
overrode terrestrial ecosystems; and terrestrial ecosystems overrode marine and coastal systems. 
The approach is not ideal, but until the National Biodiversity Assessment 2018 when an integrated 
ecosystem map is anticipated to be a core product, this map developed for the NPAES is likely to be 
the best available. 
 
68 The term biozone is used as it is more compatible with the ecosystem classifications in marine and estuarine 
systems than a biome. For terrestrial systems the concept is identical to a biome, but the actual mapped 
extent of the terrestrial biozone will be different to its associated biome. This is caused by the fact that an area 
which was a single biome (e.g. Grasslands) was divided into terrestrial, river and wetland areas. This will clearly 
reduce the total mapped extent of the Grasslands. 
69 Based on the Mucina and Rutherford (2006) vegetation map with some revised units in KwaZulu-Natal, the 
Western Cape and Mpumalanga. 
70 This map is based on the NFEPA wetland dataset (Nel et al., 2011), but has not yet been formally released 
and does not have an updated reference. 
71 The mapping process is described in Sink et al. (2012). Some subsequent refinements of ecosystems near 
that Orange River mouth were also included. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 108

Technical Note 4: Integrated ecosystem condition map
A second mapping input required for the evaluation of achievement of targets is an ecosystem 
condition map. The underlying principle is that areas that are no longer intact (e.g. large dams, 
roads, rest camps, canalized sections of rivers and plantations of exotic trees) should not contribute 
to targets even if they are in protected areas. Hence, the preparation of a fully integrated ecosystem 
condition map covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems was a 
key activity for the NPAES. Although good maps of individual ecosystem condition now exist, these 
maps had not previously been integrated. A map was developed for the NPAES that identified good, 
fair and poor condition areas of each ecosystem (Figure A 3).
The mapping primarily used DEA’s recently released National Land Cover (NLC 2013/2014)72 for 
inland areas. The 72 land cover or land use classes were each classified as either good (for natural 
and semi-natural areas), fair (for degraded systems) or poor (for heavily modified systems such as 
mining, plantation, arable agriculture or urban land uses). For marine ecosystems, estuaries, rivers 
and wetlands the ecosystem condition maps developed for the respective components of the 
National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 were used. The layers were used to develop individual 
 
72 DEA, 2014. This dataset is © Geoterraimage (2014).

condition maps for the areas covered by each ecosystem type. These individual layers were then 
integrated based on the habitat type present at a site. Finally, if a site was mapped in the new 
National Land Cover as being in fair or poor condition, this value overrode any other input as it was 
likely to be more accurate. This process produced the first ever integrated ecosystem condition map 
for South Africa. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 111 
Appendix 3: Review of implementation of Phase 1 of the NPAES (2008 – 2014)
The first phase of the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy, covering the period 2008 – 2014, 
has been completed73. This appendix serves to review the progress made in implementing Phase 1 
of the NPAES. This review reports on progress made in: (i) the formal declaration of new areas as 
protected areas; (ii) the negotiation (but not yet completed) of new areas for declaration as 
protected areas; (iii) the development of institutionally-based PAES’s; (iv) the implementation of 
different protected area expansion mechanisms; (v) securing financial and human resources to 
support protected area expansion efforts; and (vi) the development of the enabling conditions (legal, 
policy, information management, incentives, cooperative governance) for protected area expansion. 
Based on the lessons learnt in the implementation of phase 1 of the NPAES, the review further 
identifies key challenges to protected area expansion that will need to be addressed in phase 2 of 
the NPAES in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of protected area expansion efforts.
1. New areas declared as protected areas 
In Phase 1 of the NPAES, a total area of 189 433.36km2
 was added to the protected area system, 
through 460 formal declarations. Over 95% (180 851.37km2
) of this total is attributed to the 
declaration of a single protected area, the Prince Edward Island marine protected area (situated in 
the Prince Edward Island EEZ). Table A 3 presents a breakdown of the new areas declared as 
protected areas during the period of review, by protected area type.

In the terrestrial environment, approximately 31% of the area originally targeted for expansion in 
phase 1 (i.e. 27 000.00km2 or 2.2% of the country’s surface area) was formally declared74. The spatial 
distribution of the new areas included into the terrestrial protected area system, for the period of 
review is shown in Figure A 4. 
 
73 The actual timeframe for Phase 1 of the NPAES is 2008-2013. This review of progress was however only
initiated at the end of 2014. It was thus considered prudent to include 2014 into the period of review. 
74 No specific targets were however set for different protected area types. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 112 
75
Of the 830 322ha added to the terrestrial protected area system, over 560 000ha of this was 
privately owned (502 692ha) or under some form of communal tenure (59 175ha), and declared 
under a contractual agreement without a change in ownership (Table A 4). This suggests that the 
negotiation of formal contractual agreements with people who have private or communal land 
tenure has become the primary tool for protected area expansion in terrestrial habitats (see 
discussion in section 2).
Most protected area agencies, with the exception of Limpopo and Free State, concluded new 
terrestrial protected area declarations in Phase 1 (see also Table A ).

75 At the time that the NPAES (2008) was developed, there were many protected areas that were functioning 
as de facto protected areas but were not formally declared. These areas were included in national protected 
area calculations. Formalising their status by declaring them was identified as an important mechanism for 
protected area expansion – although this did not expand the actual area. De facto protected areas that have 
been proclaimed are recorded here.

75National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 113 
The NPAES established the important principle of representing each habitat type within the 
protected area network, and set representation targets for each of South Africa’s terrestrial habitat 
types76
. Table A gives a summary of the NPAES targets for land-based protected areas, and 
summarizes progress towards meeting them77,78. As only intact areas contribute to meeting 
representation targets, the new DEA land-cover database was used to evaluate the actual 
contribution existing and expanded protected areas make by removing impacted areas such as 
dams, rest camps, roads and fields. For this reason79, the total areas contributing to meeting 
representation targets for habitats are less than the full area of protected area added. This is 
particularly the case for Protected Environments which often consist of a mosaic of different land 
uses.
Table A shows that progress towards meeting the targets set in the NPAES has been mixed. When 
all habitats are considered, the areas effectively contributing to meeting targets improved from 3.6% 
to 3.9% (based on current protected areas), and will move to 4.2% if additional sites under 
negotiation are all completed80. Currently, this equates to 18% of the 5-year target and 4.5% of the 
20-year target. Should all areas under negotiation be completed, 8.3% of the 20-year target will have 
been met. Clearly progress towards meeting targets has been slower than the NPAES proposed. Best 
progress (as measured by the % of the 5-year target met) has been made in the Forest biome, where 
the area declared exceeds the short term target with 129% of the target being achieved, while good 
progress was also made in the waterbodies biome and the Albany Thicket biome with 91% and 69% 
of the 5-year targets being met respectively. No progress was made in the Desert biome and Indian 
Ocean coastal Belt, and little progress was made in the Nama-Karoo, Savanna and Grassland biomes 
with only 9%, 14% and 16% respectively of the 5-year targets being met. Two biomes which were 
not include in the NPAES (2008) (i.e. the Subantarctic Tundra biome and the Polar Desert biome) are 
both fully protected. 
 
76 Habitat specific representation targets could not be set for freshwater, marine and coastal types in the 
NPAES in 2008 as no suitable habitat maps existed at that time. These targets are set in NPAES 2016. 
77 Detailed data for each individual ecosystem type are given in the Appendix 1. 
78 Importantly, there are major differences between the NPAES 2008 spatial data, the current spatial data and 
the summaries of the areas declared that were submitted by the different protected area agencies. In addition 
to the landcover related issue, a fundamental issue is that many of the protected areas legally declared during 
the period 2008 to 2014 were already included as De facto protected areas in the NPAES 2008. We have hence 
developed a protected area layer specifically for the evaluation of habitat representation that examines the 
effective extent of protection. The figure in the habitat representation layer cannot be directly compared with 
the protected area declaration data. 
79 This, along with updates on the base protected area data layer, results in the protected area extent reported 
in the NPAES 2008 differing from the 2008 figures used in the current evaluation. 
80 These figures are far smaller than the full extent of the protected network as many Lowveld Savanna, Arid 
Savanna and Mountain Fynbos types are over-represented in terms of habitat targets. This does not imply that 
there are not excellent reasons to protect these extra areas (e.g. securing threatened species, protection of 
areas supplying water, securing habitat for wide-ranging species, protecting full functioning ecosystems, 
securing the country against climate change, and to support the tourism industry), but merely that these areas 
are beyond the minimum required habitat representation target. National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 114

Table A 5: Improvement in representation of terrestrial habitat types in protected areas.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 115 
Table A and Table A show that although progress has been slower than anticipated, the expansion 
has largely been in areas which increase the efficiency and representivity of the protected area 
network. The NPAES identified 42 focus areas for land-based protected area expansion. Overall 59% 
(or 662 301ha) of the current expansion took place in these priority focus areas (Figure A 5). Of the 
current areas under negotiation, a far lower percentage (36% or 200 623ha) are within the priority 
focus areas. Importantly, as the priority focus areas identified in the NPAES examined only large 
intact priorities and not fragmented threatened habitats or finer scale provincial priorities, this does 
not imply that the current expansion outside of the focus areas is poorly located. Nor does it imply 
that the areas under negotiation are less of a priority.

In the marine environment, the declaration of the marine protected area (MPA) in the Prince 
Edward Island (PEI) EEZ resulted in marine protected areas far exceeding the short- and long-term 
NPAES targets (by a factor of 2) for the PEI EEZ. However, during the period of review no offshore 
MPAs were declared (against a short-term target of 52 500 km2
 in the NPAES) for the mainland EEZ 
and only 2 inshore MPAs (27 878 ha81) were declared, resulting in an under-representation of these 
habitats in meeting the overall targets for the marine protected area system. The spatial distribution 
of the new areas included into the marine protected area system for the period of review is shown 
in Figure A 4. 
Table A summarizes the progress towards achieving specific NPAES targets in the Marine Inshore 
and Marine Offshore environments. As no suitable habitat maps existed when the NPAES 2008 was 
undertaken no habitat specific representation targets were set at that time, and therefore we can 
only evaluate progress across these environments as a whole. Overall, better progress has been 
made in the marine environment than in terrestrial areas. 
In particular, good progress has been made in the marine offshore: Prince Edward Islands EEZ 
region, where the 20-year no-take target and the overall protected area target have effectively both 
been met through the declaration of the Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area. Progress in 
the marine inshore and marine offshore (mainland) EEZ environments has not matched that around 
the Prince Edward Islands. In the marine offshore (mainland) EEZ environment the protected area 
network was extremely limited in 2008 with only 0.4% of the area being protected (and only 0.16% 
being no-take). During phase 1 an additional 0.03% of the marine offshore (mainland) EEZ 
environment was declared of which 0.02% is no-take. This represents under 1% of the 5-year NPAES 
target. Progress in improving the current representation is likely to be better in phase 2 as significant 
 
81 The NPAES set a short-term target of 88km of coastline for inshore MPAs, but no area-based targets.

areas in this environment (representing 6.7% of the area and 32% of the 20-year target) are under 
negotiation through Operation Phakisa. 
The 2008 baseline for the marine inshore environment, was 20.6% (741km) having some protection 
of which 7.9% (285km) was no-take. Eighty nine percent of the phase 1 target for no-take areas was 
met, while 163% of the 5-year target for overall inshore protection was met. Progress on no-take 
MPAs has been slower than required and will require specific attention in future phases of the 
NPAES. 
2. Areas still under active negotiation for inclusion into the protected area 
network (2008 – 2014) 
The areas still under active negotiation for future declaration as terrestrial protected areas – totaling 
some 1 180 997ha82 – vary widely between protected area institutions (Figure A 6).
 
82 This total is indicative only- not all of this area will be successfully negotiated to the point of formal 
declaration. 
Figure A 6: Areas under negotiation for terrestrial protected area expansion, by 
protected area institution (ha).National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 119 
The areas still under active negotiation for future declaration as terrestrial protected areas show a 
clear spatial bias towards private and communally owned land (Figure A 7).
3. Mechanisms for expansion 
In the terrestrial environment, the conclusion of a contractual agreement between the protected 
area institution and a landowner or land user (in the case of communal land) was the primary 
mechanism used to declare new terrestrial protected areas during phase 1 of the NPAES (Table A ).
Of the total land incorporated into the terrestrial protected area system, contractual agreements 
accounted for 68% (563 947ha) of the extent of declared protected areas. Ninety three percent of 
the area under contractual agreements (522 128ha) was brokered on private and communal land 
through the biodiversity stewardship programmes. 
Although the process of formally assigning and declaring state land accounted for 39% of the 
declarations, the extent of declared protected areas (157 743ha) comprised only 19% of the total 
expansion in phase 1. 
SANParks is the only protected area institution which purchased land (106 663ha) for protected area 
expansion in phase 1.

Contractual agreement 164 563 947
Land acquisition (incl. donations) 117 108 631
Declaration of state land 176 157 743
Four protected area institutions formalised the declaration of state owned land that was already 
being managed as de facto protected areas (but not yet declared), while seven protected area 
institutions concluded contractual agreements for the declaration of protected areas (Table A ). Of 
Figure A 7: Area under negotiation for terrestrial protected area expansion, by 
land tenure. (ha)National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 120 
the land managed under contractual agreement, 29% (161 810ha) is managed by the state while the 
remainder is privately managed.

All three protected area mechanisms - contractual agreement, land acquisition and declaration of 
state owned land - were used in the expansion of National Parks and Nature Reserves. Contractual 
agreements were the only expansion mechanism used in the establishment of Protected 
Environments, while the declaration of state owned land was the only expansion mechanism used 
for Forest Nature Reserves (Table A ).

4. The development of institutionally-based Protected Area Expansion 
Strategy’s (PAES) (2008 – 2014) 
In the terrestrial environment, only one protected area institution - CapeNature - had a PAES (in the 
form of a Biodiversity Stewardship Plan) in 2008. By the end of phase 1 however, eight of the twelve 
protected area institutions have now developed, adopted and are implementing an institutionallybased PAES. These institutionally-based PAES’s are all closely aligned to the strategic objectives of 
the NPAES, although the implementation phases are not yet fully harmonised (Table A ). 
Three of the remaining protected area institutions (Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape) are 
currently developing or have developed their own PAES’s and are in the process of getting them 
adopted. Only one protected area institution – DAFF – currently has no plans to develop an 
institutionally-based PAES and is using the NPAES to guide its priorities for protected area expansion.

Expansion plans for the marine environment are well developed and were recently published as part 
of Operation Phakisa. The total area targeted for expansion of the MPA network is 64 807.10km2
(covering 21 separate MPAs in the inshore and off-shore mainland EEZ). 
5. Resource allocations to PAES (2014) 
The institutional capacity to implement the protected area expansion programme is limited. An 
estimate of the human resources85 available (as of end December 2014) for implementing the 
protected area expansion programme is presented in Table A .

area institution.

and facilitators, planners, legal staff, ecologists, technicians and extension staff. 
86 Staff availability is broken down into those staff that spend more than 60% of their time on protected area 
expansion and those who have a role to play but spend less than 60% of their time on the function.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 122 
The estimated operational87 budgets for protected area expansion are highly variable (Table A 14).
The funding resources for protected area expansion, and the actual performance of the protected 
area agency in declaring new areas as protected areas, do not show a close correlation which 
suggests that some agencies are more efficient in expanding their protected areas.

6. Legal and institutional developments (2008 – 2014) 
Phase 1 of the NPAES (2008) saw a number of legal and administrative developments aimed at 
advancing protected area expansion. These include: 
 The amendment of the Protected Areas Act to include marine protected areas. 
 The process of developing standardised stewardship guidelines was advanced. 
 Refinements in the incentives for declaring privately owned and managed protected areas 
through tax rebates. 
 Improved levels of legislative compliance through the development of the Protected Area 
Register. 
 The advanced development of a protected area database, linked to the Protected Area 
Register, which is populated with Stats SA-verified data only. 
 The establishment of a national protected area co-ordination and standardisation forum (the 
Protected Area Technical Task Team; PATTT), which includes the mandate for protected area 
expansion. 
 Publishing guidelines for the declaration of different types of protected areas.
7. Key protected area expansion issues and challenges (2008 – 2014) 
The review process brought to light a number of key issues and concerns that warrant consideration 
in the development of an action plan for phase 2 of the NPAES. These include inter alia: 
 Inadequate funds to increase and sustain the biodiversity stewardship programme: All 
protected area institutions involved in the biodiversity stewardship programme highlighted 
the concern that as more areas were being successfully contracted under the biodiversity 
stewardship programme, the need for maintenance engagements and auditing of these sites 
increases. This maintenance and auditing function thus requires a greater slice of the current 
budget as well as increased staff time. Attention needs to be paid to ways of covering the 
increasing maintenance costs of the biodiversity stewardship programme while maintaining 
adequate resources to continue with protected area expansion efforts. 
 
87 This includes budgets that institutions have for land purchase.National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 123 
 Declining availability of funds for the SANParks land purchase fund: The purchase by 
SANParks of key land for protected area expansion was possible through the land purchase 
fund. This fund is dependent on ad hoc grants from DEA to function and these grants have 
been cut substantially in recent years. 
 Staff numbers, staff turnover, staff capacity and institutional support: Many protected area 
institutions raised the need for their agency to better align their staffing (both in terms of 
numbers and capacity) with the requirements of implementing their institutional PAESs. A 
range of skills and expertise is required to successfully declare new protected areas, from 
field-based negotiators to stewardship managers and from legal support to planners and 
ecologists. Mention was made of the negative effects of high staff turnover and the need for 
improving the career paths of individuals involved in protected area expansion efforts. 
 Data and data management: The review has highlighted the widespread need for improved 
data and data management systems to ensure that the protected area expansion function is 
being based on reliable, updated and accessible information. 
 Alignment of the NPAES and institutional level plans: Not all institutional PAES plans are 
aligned with the national plans. This may result in areas being added to the protected area 
system which contribute little towards target achievement. The need to promote better 
alignment between the NPAES and the institutionally-based PAESs has been highlighted. 
 Legal and administrative barriers: All institutions indicated that administrative (including 
legal) barriers were one of the major bottlenecks in declaring new protected areas. The need 
for a task team to identify the major barriers and to seek ways to remove or reduce them 
was identified as important in taking the protected area expansion programme forward.
