community as the primary drivers of anthropogenic climate change, and for
AND WHEREAS anthropogenic climate change represents an urgent threat to
human societies and the planetary environment and requires an effective,
progressive and incremental response;
WHEREAS everyone has the Constitutional right to dignity, life and an environment
that is not harmful to their health and well- being, and to have the environment
protected for the benefit of present and future generations while allowing justifiable

competitive lower carbon economy and society, that takes into account the
economic, employment and societal risks and opportunities that are expected to
arise as a consequence of implementing the national climate change response;
AND WHEREAS anticipated domestic climate change impacts have the potential to
undermine many of the gains made in meeting the Republic's developmental goals,
while implementing an effective national climate change response, set out in the
White Paper on National Climate Change Response and South Africa's Nationally
Determined Contribution communicated to the United Nations Convention on
Combating Climate Change secretariat in terms of its Paris Agreement, as may be
varied from time to time, will -
(a) contribute to the realisation of significant macro- economic, socio- economic and
environmental benefits, in a manner that is driven and customised in the light of
national circumstances; developmental; transformational; empowering and
participatory; dynamic and evidence- based; balanced and cost effective; and
(b) is especially vulnerable to those impacts of climate change that require urgent
and appropriate adaptation responses; and
(c) has committed, internationally, to communicate and implement an effective
nationally determined climate change response, including mitigation and
adaptation actions, that represents the Republic's fair contribution to the
global climate change response;

governance approaches which require a nationally driven, coordinated and
cooperative legal and administrative response that acknowledges the centrality of
the provincial and municipal spheres in achieving its objectives, thus making it
desirable to develop a legislative framework for the implementation of the Republic's
national climate change response in order to address these matters;
