 Executive Summary

South Africa “needs to protect the natural environment in all respects, leaving subsequent
generations with at least an endowment of at least equal value”

Executive Summary of the National Development Plan 2030 (p 37)

The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is a requirement of contracting
parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). NBSAPs set out a strategy and plan for
contracting parties to fulfil the objectives of the Convention. With the adoption of the CBD’s
Strategic Plan for Biodiversity for 2011-2020, parties agreed to revise and align their NBSAPs
to the Strategic Plan and the Aichi Targets.

This document is South Africa’s revised NBSAP for the period 2015 — 2025. It identifies the
priorities for biodiversity management in South Africa for this period, aligning these with the
priorities and targets in the global agenda, as well as national development imperatives.

South Africa is a country with a rich endowment of natural resources, which include its
biodiversity and ecosystems. The diversity of these ecosystems delivers a range of services
that are essential to people and the development and growth of the economy. The NBSAP
outlines a path to ensure the management of biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure
continue to support South Africa’s development path and play an important role in
underpinning the economy.

Vision of the NBSAP:

Conserve, manage and sustainably use biodiversity to ensure equitable benefits to the
people of South Africa, now and in the future.

Strategic objectives:

1. Management of biodiversity assets and their contribution to the economy, rural
development, job creation and social wellbeing is enhanced.

2. Investments in ecological infrastructure enhance resilience and ensure benefits to
society

3. Biodiversity considerations are mainstreamed into policies, strategies and practices of
a range of sectors.

4. People are mobilized to adopt practices that sustain the long-term benefits of
biodiversity.

5. Conservation and management of biodiversity is improved through the development
of an equitable and suitably skilled workforce.

6. Effective knowledge foundations, including indigenous knowledge and citizen science,
support the management, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Figure 1. Vision and strategic objectives of the NBSAP

The vision of the NBSAP articulates the long-term goal for the state of biodiversity in the
country. Six strategic objectives? reflect the most pressing issues that the NBSAP seeks to

1 The ‘strategic objectives’ in South Africa’s NBSAP are sometimes called ‘strategic goals’ in other
NBSAPs. They represent the most pressing issues to address to achieve the vision for biodiversity
 address in support of the vision. Each strategic objective is broken down into a
comprehensive set of outcomes, which are the priorities for the strategic objective. Each
outcome is then addressed through a number of activities. The strategic objectives and
outcomes are summarized in Table 1 in the Executive Summary, and discussed in more detail
in National Action Plan (main report).

Indicators and targets have
been identified at the
outcome level. As far as
possible, the indicators and
targets have been drawn
from existing national or
organizational strategic
plans in South Africa. This
has served two functions.
While serving as a means to
track progress towards
implementing the NBSAP,
the indicators and targets
also enable alignment
between the NBSAP and
South Africa’s development
imperatives. This has
ensured that the NBSAP is

Sustainability in this context implies ecological sustainability. It
recognises that the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and
natural resources are preconditions for human wellbeing. It also
recognises that there are limits to the goods and services that can
be provided. In other words, ecological sustainability
acknowledges that human beings are part of nature and not a
separate entity.

Sustainable development is the process that is followed to achieve
the goal of sustainability. Sustainable development implies the
selection and implementation of a development option, which
allows for appropriate and justifiable social and economic goals to
be achieved, based on the meeting of basic needs and equity,
without compromising the natural system on which it is based.

2014)

firmly integrated and aligned with the strategic priorities and plans of major role players in
South Africa and therefore represents a common vision and plan for biodiversity

management.

The preparation, coordination and monitoring of the NBSAP is led by the Department of

Environmental Affairs. The implementation of the NBSAP will be coordinated and monitored
through the existing intergovernmental and sectoral coordination structures. In addition, DEA
will convene an annual forum with all role players to review progress towards the
implementation of the NBSAP.

Costing South Africa’s NBSAP and the development of a resource mobilization plan will be
pursued through the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). BIOFIN is a global initiative
funded by the European Union and managed by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). BIOFIN is working in pilot countries, including South Africa, to develop a
comprehensive national resource mobilizing strategy, improve cost effectiveness through the
mainstreaming of biodiversity into national development and sectoral planning, and develop
a methodology for quantifying the biodiversity finance gap at national level.

 Introduction

The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is a requirement that contracting
parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are obligated to fulfil. An NBSAP sets
out an integrated, coherent national strategy for the conservation, management and
sustainable use of biodiversity and specifically, outlines how contracting parties will fulfil the
objectives of the Convention. The NBSAP also provides a framework for the integration of
biodiversity considerations into other sectoral plans and strategies, and as such, is an
important mainstreaming tool.

With the adoption of a revised and updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity for 2011-2020,
including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, at the tenth Conference of Parties of the CBD held in
Nagoya, Japan, parties agreed to revise and update their national biodiversity strategies and
action plans in terms of this overarching framework. This document represents South Africa’s
revised NBSAP.

In addition to fulfilling requirements under the CBD, South Africa’s NBSAP also seeks to
integrate South Africa’s obligations under the CBD into its national development and sectoral
planning frameworks and makes explicit links to the priorities and strategies of a wide range
of role players and sectors. The NBSAP is therefore both a vehicle for mainstreaming as well
as a mainstreaming tool in itself.

This document outlines:

e How South Africa’s NBSAP is situated in relation to the CBD and the biodiversity-
related national policy framework.

e The process undertaken in the revision of the NBSAP, including the lessons learnt
since the NBSAP 2005 and the stakeholder engagement processes.

e Asummarized account of the policy, legislative, and institutional context for
biodiversity.

e Asummary of the state of South Africa’s biodiversity assets and ecological
infrastructure and the pressures on biodiversity, drawing on the Fifth National Report
to the CBD.

e Against this context, the revised NBSAP is presented, followed by a suit of flagship
projects that embody one or a number of activities in the NBSAP, help to make the
case for biodiversity, are strategically important for biodiversity and development,
and demonstrate how the NBSAP will be implemented.

e The document then sets out the structures for institutional coordination and
communication of the NBSAP, as well as its monitoring and evaluation.
 Development and revision of South Africa’s NBSAP

South Africa’s NBSAP 2005

South Africa developed its first NBSAP between 2003 and 2005 in terms of Article 6 of the
Convention on Biological Diversity, General Measures for Conservation and Sustainable Use,
which calls for the development of national strategies, plans or programmes and the
integration of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral or
cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies.

South Africa’s first NBSAP included a spatial component, the National Spatial Biodiversity
Assessment 2004 (NSBA), which provided the first comprehensive national assessment of the
status of biodiversity at the ecosystem level across terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine and
marine ecosystems. Through its focus on ecosystems, the NSBA followed a landscape
approach to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience. Using systematic biodiversity
planning, the NSBA provided biodiversity targets, spatial priorities and indicators that can be
fed into a wide range of other environmental reports and plans at national and regional scale.
The NSBA has also informed the development of provincial and local spatial biodiversity plans
and protected area expansion strategies.

The 2005 NBSAP was taken a step further with the requirement in terms of the Biodiversity
Act to publish a National Biodiversity Framework (NBF). The first NBF, gazetted in 2009,
provides a framework to coordinate and align efforts of many organisations and individuals
involved in biodiversity management and conservation. It focusses attention on the top
priority actions and targets for biodiversity management and conservation for the period
2008 — 2013. Together, the NBF and the NBSAP form the medium term and long range
strategic plans for biodiversity management in South Africa. Figure 3 illustrates the
relationship between the CBD, the NBSAP, the NBF, and the NBA (see Figure 4).

Framework)
 The National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) 2011 is the second assessment of the state of South
Africa’s biodiversity, across terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine and marine environments, placing an
emphasis on spatial (mapped) information for both ecosystems and species. It synthesises key
aspects of South Africa’s biodiversity science, making it available in a useful form to policymakers,
decision-makers and practitioners in a range of sectors. The NBA includes two headline indicators
that are assessed across all environments: ecosystem threat status and ecosystem protection level.

Completed every five to seven years, the NBA is central to fulfilling SANBI’s mandate to monitor
and report on the state of biodiversity. It is developed over several years, led by SANBI in
partnership with a range of organisations, involving wide participation from stakeholders, scientists
and biodiversity management experts throughout the country.

The first national assessment of biodiversity in South African was completed in 2004 and called the
National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (NSBA 2004). It dealt only with spatial aspects of
biodiversity. The NBA 2011 added non-spatial thematic elements such as the state of species of
special concern and invasive alien species. The NBA 2011 also presents new work on geographic
areas that contribute to climate change resilience, and provides a summary of spatial biodiversity
priority areas that have been identified through systematic biodiversity plans at national, provincial
and local scales. Systematic biodiversity planning (particularly with regards to conserving ecological
processes that support persistence of biodiversity) and assessments of climate change resilience at
a landscape scale both take into account features or areas important to maintaining connectivity in
landscapes.

The NBA 2011 highlights South Africa’s exceptional endowment of biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure. Ecological infrastructure are the naturally functioning ecosystems that
deliver valuable ecosystem services to people, such as fresh water, climate regulation, soil
formation and disaster risk reduction. These areas and other biodiversity assets offer significant
opportunities to unlock the value of biodiversity and ecosystems in support of the country’s
development path. The NBA 2011 and the knowledge gathered in its development makes a
substantial contribution to towards this, through a growing knowledge base on the value of
ecosystems and how to manage them. For this reason, the NBA 2011 informs the revision and
updating of key national biodiversity policies and strategies, including the NBSAP, the National
Biodiversity Framework (NBF) and the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy. In addition,
information from the NBA can be used to streamline environmental decision-making, strengthen
land-use planning, strengthen strategic planning about optimal development futures for South
Africa, and identify priorities for management and restoration of ecosystems with related
opportunities for ecosystem-based job creation.

Developing a revised NBSAP

In line with the CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and Target 17 of the Aichi
Biodiversity Targets, there is a requirement for Parties to the Convention to update and revise
their NBSAPs. South Africa initiated the process of revising and updating the 2005 NBSAP in
2013. A project steering committee? was established with representatives from the
Department of Environmental Affairs, the South African National Biodiversity Institute, South
African National Parks, and the Western Cape Provincial Government which is developing a
provincial biodiversity strategy and action plan. In 2014 a consulting team was appointed to
develop the revised NBSAP.

The revised NBSAP has drawn on two recent reports as key informants:

? Extracted from the NBA 2011

3 A list of project steering committee members is provided in the annexures.
 e In its Fifth National Report to the CBD, South Africa undertook an analysis of progress
against the NBSAP 2005. A short synopsis of this review, including lessons learnt, is
included below. The revision of the NBSAP drew on this analysis, noting where work
still needs to be done to address certain priorities, recognizing where progress has
been made that lays foundations to deepen these areas of work, and identifying
priorities that have emerged more recently. The NBSAP 2015 is therefore built on the
outcomes of the NBSAP 2005.

e The 2004 NSBA was updated with the release of the 2011 National Biodiversity
Assessment (NBA). Drawing on the best available science, the NBA provides headline
indicators for monitoring and reporting and summarises spatial biodiversity priorities.
As with the previous NBSAP, the outcomes of the NBA 2011 have informed the
revised NBSAP (see Figure 4).

consultations were consolidated into a first draft of the core biodiversity strategy and action
plan which was circulated in advance of the second national stakeholder consultation
workshop in April 2015. This workshop further refined and streamlined the NBSAP into a set
of sensible, achievable and aspirational priorities and activities and took steps towards the
development of an action plan. The outcome of this process was consolidated into a second
draft which was circulated for comment before the final version of the NBSAP was developed.

The revision of the NBSAP has aligned with a project funded by the European Union-and
managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) known as Biodiversity
Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). BIOFIN is a global initiative launched during the 11° Conference of
the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October 2012. BIOFION seeks to
address the biodiversity finance challenge in a comprehensive manner by defining
biodiversity finance needs and gaps through detailed national-level assessments and

 determining and leveraging challenges and opportunities for resource mobilisation. This
Initiative is managed by the UNDP in partnership with the European Commission and the
Governments of Germany and Switzerland. Currently, 29 countries are participating in
BIOFIN, including South Africa.

At a national level, BIOFIN aims to develop a resource mobilisation strategy, improve cost
effectiveness through mainstreaming biodiversity into national development and sectoral
planning, and quantify the biodiversity finance gap. This equates to costing the
implementation of the NBSAP and addressing the finance gap through the implementation of
a resource mobilisation plan. In South Africa, BIOFIN is being implemented by the
Department of Environmental Affairs in collaboration with the National Treasury.

Lessons learnt from an analysis of implementation of the 2005 NBSAP

The NBSAP 2005 is structured around five Strategic Objectives, each of which has a series of
27 outcomes and 122 activities. In order to assess implementation of the NBSAP 2005 for the
Fifth National Report to the CBD, an analysis of progress was undertaken at the activity level?.
Progress towards implementation for each of the 122 activities was rated in one of four
categories:

Green — fully achieved

Yellow — substantially achieved

e Orange — achieved to a limited extent
e Red-—not achieved

The results are summarised in Figure 6.

Overall, 27% of the activities in the NBSAP 2005 have been fully achieved, another 27%
substantially achieved, 37% achieved to a limited extent, and 6% not achieved. Three percent
of activities are no longer applicable, for example because they addressed a policy or
institutional process that subsequently changed or fell away.

Based on this analysis, the highest proportion of activities achieved and substantially achieved
is for Strategic Objective 2 which deals with institutional effectiveness. However, this does
not necessarily reflect the areas of greatest progress in implementing the NBSAP in practice,
as a number of activities actually undertaken since the NBSAP was finalised in 2005 could not
have been foreseen at that stage and were thus not included. A fuller analysis of progress
towards the NBSAP needs to consider those activities that contribute towards the strategic
objectives but which emerged after the NBSAP was finalized. Many of these activities are
captured in the Fifth National Report to the CBD.

Figure 6: Summary of extent to which 2005 NBSAP activities have been implemented (by strategic objective) (Source:
Fifth National Report to the CBD)

A number of lessons emerged from this analysis and have informed the revision of the
NBSAP.

Firstly, the need for a bold and transformative agenda must be balanced with what is
achievable in the NBSAP timeframe, particularly for mainstreaming activities. Since 2005,
South Africa has developed considerable experience in biodiversity mainstreaming. This
experience has highlighted that the time required for mainstreaming processes is longer than
anticipated as mainstreaming works at effecting systemic change, which is often enduring,
but takes longer to achieve.

Secondly, as highlighted by the 3 percent of activities that fell away, being very specific about
policy and institutional activities is challenged by the fact that these activities, particularly
when mainstreaming, are often opportunistic and usually beyond direct control. Where policy
related activities are within a line function and thus more directly controlled, there is still a
degree of flux that makes policy processes difficult to control.

A third lesson, taking a broader view, is that the work in the biodiversity sector has evolved
and developed substantially in the past 10 years, with a range of strategies being developed
to address various aspects of natural resource management and socio-economic
development. These include the National Water Resources Strategy, the National Biodiversity
Economy Strategy, national and provincial Protected Area Expansion Strategies, the Water
RDI Roadmap, the Man and Biosphere Reserve Strategy, the National Biodiversity Research
Strategy, amongst others. Not all of these are strategies developed by the environment or
biodiversity sectors, but they are important for biodiversity. The revised NBSAP seeks align
with these, not replace or repeat them.

These lessons have been core to the revision of the NBSAP. Efforts have been made to ensure
that the NBSAP 2015 supports government’s transformative agenda while recognising that
timeframes and other parameters need to be set according to the nature of different types of
activities.
 Background®

Relevant policy and legislation

South Africa has a strong policy and legislative framework for the conservation, management

and sustainable use of biodiversity.

The overall framework for environmental governance in South Africa is established in South

Africa’s Constitution (Act 108 of 1996) which:

e Protects the “right to an environment
that is not harmful to health and well-
being”;

e Balances the right to have the
environment protected with rights to
valid social and economic development;
and by

e  Allocates environmental functions to a
wide range of government agencies in
all spheres and requiring co-operation
between government agencies and
spheres of government.

At the time of the NBSAP 2005, South Africa’s
policy and legislative framework for the
conservation, management and sustainable use
of biodiversity was already well-developed.
Under the National Environmental Management
Act (NEMA) (Act 107 of 1998), the NEM:
Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004) (hereafter
referred to as the Biodiversity Act) still provides
the main legislative framework for the
management of biodiversity; and the NEM:
Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003) (hereafter
referred to as the Protected Areas Act) still
provides for the protection and conservation of
biodiversity.

Significant additions to the framework

subsequent to that included the publication of
the:

e National Biodiversity Framework (2008),
which was published in 2009 in
accordance with the Biodiversity Act,

e The Constitution (Act 108 of 1996)

with the purpose of coordinating and aligning the efforts of the organisations and
individuals involved in conserving and managing South Africa’s biodiversity through
the identification of 33 priority actions for the period 2008 to 2013.

® The background for biodiversity management and conservation has been written about repeatedly.
This section therefore draws heavily on relevant resources South Africa’s Country Reports to the CBD
(RSA 2014, DEAT 2009), NBA (2011), and somewhat from other resources such as DEA (2005), SANBI

(2014a, b and c), DEA et al. (2013).
 e National Protected Area Expansion Strategy (2008), the goal of which is to achieve
cost-effective expansion of the protected area network that enhances ecological
sustainability and resilience to climate change through setting ecosystem-specific
targets for protected area expansion, identifying geographic focus areas for land-
based protected area expansion, and making recommendations about mechanisms
for protected area expansion.

The key elements of the policy and legal framework for biodiversity include those listed in
Figure 77, a quick glance at which shows that there have not been fundamental changes in
biodiversity policy in South Africa since 2009. There have, however, been some changes or
improvements to strengthen implementation including:

e Amendments to key elements of the legislative framework, such as to the:
o Biodiversity Act including amendments, among others to increase the
maximum penalties for contraventions in terms of the Biodiversity Act
(published in 2009) and to expand the scope of the regulatory provisions
relating to alien and listed invasive species, and to enhance the
circumstances in which issuing authorities may refuse, cancel or suspend
permits in order to limit abuse of the permit system (published in 2013).
o Protected Areas Act to clarify certain issues and facilitate implementation.
e Publication of new, and amendments to various existing norms and standards,
regulations, and guidelines published and implemented in terms of the Biodiversity
Act such as to the:
o Regulations for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES)
o National Moratorium on Trade of Individual Rhinoceros Horns
o Amendments to the Norms and Standards for the Marking of Rhinoceros and
Rhinoceros Horn, and for the Hunting of Rhinoceros for Trophy Hunting
Purposes
o Prohibition of Trade in Certain Encephalartos (Cycad) Species
Amendments to the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations and
review of the species list (based on the Red List assessment process).

(BABS) and the Bioprospecting, Access and Benefit Sharing Regulatory
Framework: Guidelines for Providers, Users and Regulators
e Publication in terms of the Integrated Coastal Management Act (Act 24 of 2008):
o National Coastal Management Programme

e Some provinces have revised or are in the process of revising their biodiversity
legislation.

Policy evolution is ongoing and is important for responding to emerging issues, gaps, and
clarifying certain issues to facilitate implementation. It is also influenced by international

conventions, treaties, protocols and other agreements that South Africa has signed and
ratified. These include:

e The three Rio Conventions, which are intrinsically linked, operating in the same
ecosystems and addressing interdependent issues:
o UN Convention on Biological Diversity, ratified in 1995, and the two
 Convention Protocols namely,
= The Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety to the CBD (governing the
movement of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from
biotechnology from one country to another)
= The Nagoya Protocol on Access to genetic resources and the fair and
equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation to the CBD.
o UN Convention to Combat Desertification, ratified in 1997, South Africa’s has
subsequently developed a National Action Programme (NAP), a process in
which government, local communities and land users consider ways in which
‘0 combat desertification.
o UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified by South Africa in
1997.
e Other biodiversity-related conventions (date of ratification in brackets):
o International Plant Protection Convention (1952)

 

o Convention on Wetlands (popularly known as the Ramsar Convention) (1971)

o World Heritage Convention (1972)

o UNConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora (CITES) (1975

o Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (1975)

o International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
(2004)
e Other agreements and treaties:
o Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
o Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP)
o UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme (MAB)
o Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(CCAMLR)
o International Whaling Commission
o Antarctic Treaty
o SADC Instruments

 

A significant indication of political will and
commitment to biodiversity management and
conservation is signalled by Outcome 10 of the

that are well protected and continually enhanced’. It sets priorities for relevant government
departments and conservation agencies and forms the government's delivery and
 implementation plan for the period. The plan is reviewed annually and reported on
throughout the year, forming a key input in determining national budget allocations. Final
budget allocations affect the order of priorities and phasing of the implementation of the
delivery agreements.

Institutional context

The institutional environment for biodiversity has been described in the National Country
Reports to the CBD, and has not changed substantially in the last ten years.

The three spheres of government in South Africa — national, provincial and local — operate as
“distinctive, interdependent and interrelated” spheres of government through co-operative
governance, a principle emphasized in the Constitution. National legislative competencies
include land reform, water resources, forest resources, marine resources, national parks and
national botanical gardens. Functional areas of concurrent national and provincial legislative
competence include environmental management, pollution control, soil conservation, nature
conservation (excluding national parks, national botanical gardens and marine resources) and
regional planning and development. Local government (district and local municipalities) play
an important role in development planning and management of biodiversity. As was the case
in the NBSAP 2005, the revised NBSAP focuses attention on all levels of government to
facilitate implementation of the NBSAP but places emphasis on support to local government
to facilitate implementation.

Since the NBSAP 2005, South Africa’s public sector institutions, both nationally and
provincially, have been restructured several times. The current configuration of government
departments with mandates that link to the conservation and management of biodiversity
and natural resources is outlined below. While these changes have included the national
department responsible for the environment’, the biodiversity sector in South Africa has
remained institutionally strong and well established. It is comprised of:

e The public sector institutions that are mandated with the conservation and
management of biodiversity, including:

o Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) is South Africa’s primary
environmental custodian, mandated to protect the environment and
conserve natural resources while balancing this with sustainable
development and the equitable distribution of natural resource benefits. DEA
fulfills its mandate through formulating, coordinating and monitoring the
implementation of national environmental policies, programmes and
legislation, and through undertaking appropriate research. These include
policies, strategies, programmes and frameworks on addressing biodiversity
management and conservation, climate change, land degradation,
sustainable development and poverty alleviation. In addition, DEA has a
series of Environmental Programmes that play an important role in the
management of biodiversity and natural resources. These include Working
for Wetlands, Working for Water, Working for Land, and Working for Energy,
amongst others.

o South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) was established in terms

7 In 2005 the national department responsible for the environment included tourism and was known as
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT). This function has subsequently been
split into two departments, namely: the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and the National
Department of Tourism (NDT).

10
 of the Biodiversity Act and is a public entity, falling under the Minister of
Environmental Affairs, with the purpose of assisting in achieving the
objectives of the Biodiversity Act. Its mandate includes playing a leading role
in South Africa’s national commitment to biodiversity management
particularly in relation to the biodiversity research agenda, provision of
knowledge and information, policy support and advice, monitoring and
reporting on the state of biodiversity, and managing botanical gardens.
South African National Parks (SANParks), which was established in terms of
the Protected Areas Act as a conservation authority mandated to conserve,
protect, control and manage a system of national parks and other defined
protected areas and their biodiversity.

South African Weather Service (SAWS), which was established as a public
entity in 2001 in terms of the South African Weather Service Act (No. 8 of
2001), to be the custodian of reliable national meteorological and
climatological data, which is important to biodiversity management and
conservation.

iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority, which is an authority pursuant to
section 9 of the World Heritage Convention Act (No. 49 of 1999) was set up
to manage the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
listed for its outstanding natural values in 1999.

Provincial departments of environmental affairs and provincial conservation
authorities exist for each of South Africa’s nine provinces. The separation of
agency and the mandate of provincial conservation authorities varies across
provinces. In some cases the provincial conservation authority forms part of
the provincial department of environmental affairs; in other cases it is a
separate agency. In some cases the provincial conservation authority has a
mandate to work throughout the province concerned, both inside and
outside protected areas, while in other cases it has a mandate to work only
within protected areas (including the development and promotion of
ecotourism facilities within protected areas).

Other organs of state have a direct role in managing natural resources, and impact on
biodiversity, including:
o Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS), which shares the mandate for

managing freshwater ecosystems with DEA. It is primarily responsible for the
ormulation and implementation of policy governing the water sector, such
as the National Water Resource Strategy (NWRS), and it has overriding
responsibility for water services provided by local government (see DWA,
2013a). Revisions to the NWRS have strengthened recognition of healthy
reshwater ecosystems as important for water security. Its implementation in
general, but the chapter 5 on water resource protection in particular, is
relevant to the management of biodiversity assets and ecological
infrastructure. Revisions to the draft Water Pricing Strategy also recognise
he importance of healthy freshwater ecosystems to water security through
he inclusion of the use of revenue gained from water tariffs to support
investment into ecological infrastructure for water security.

Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), which draws its
egislative mandate from section 27(1)(b) of the Constitution of South Africa.
t is primarily responsible for Acts related to the agriculture, forestry and
isheries value chains from inputs, production and value adding to retailing
(see DAFF, 2013), much of which impacts on biodiversity management in
various ways. Mainstreaming biodiversity into agriculture, forestry and

 

11
 fishery policies, plans and practices is therefore a priority and often takes
place in ways that directly involves private sector partners, sector bodies,
NGOs and provincial departments. DAFF has a large, cross-sectoral LandCare
programme that through partnerships and cooperation seeks to conserve
and sustainably use or develop natural resources while creating jobs and
addressing poverty alleviation. The interdependencies between the
agricultural and biodiversity sectors provide important opportunities for
mainstreaming biodiversity considerations into agricultural planning, capacity
building and empowerment through the implementation of the LandCare
programme and agricultural legislation and policy, including amongst others,
he Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act (Act 43 of 1983) and the draft
Policy and Bill on Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land
Framework (PD-ALFA). Provincial departments of agriculture in some cases
include a mandate for land affairs or rural development.
o Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), which draws its
egislative mandate from the Constitution, specifically Section 25 (which
establishes the framework for the implementation of land reform), and
Section 24 and 27 (which establishes the framework for the implementation
of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme (CRDP). The
ntegrated Sustainable Rural Development programme is a large, cross-
sectoral programme focusing on development and poverty alleviation. It
presents an important opportunity to mainstream biodiversity considerations
into development planning, capacity building and community empowerment.
The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (SPLUMA) (Act 16 of
2013) provides the framework for spatial planning and land use management
and as such, holds opportunities for integrating biodiversity into
development planning.
o Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), which draws its legislative mandate
from the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (Act 28 of
2002) which provides the regulatory framework for equitable access to and
sustainable development of the nation’s mineral resources. Mainstreaming
biodiversity considerations into the mining sector is of ongoing importance to
mitigate the impacts of mining on biodiversity. DEA’s engagement with DMR
and other role players in the mining sector culminated in a “Mining and
Biodiversity Guideline: Mainstreaming Biodiversity into the Mining Sector” in
2013 (DEA et al., 2013). The guideline provides a user-friendly manual for
integrating biodiversity considerations into the planning processes and
managing biodiversity during the life cycle of a mining project, presenting this
from the perspective of risk to biodiversity priority areas and to mining
projects.
© Local government (municipalities), which has jurisdiction over significant
natural resources in urban and rural areas. A key function of municipalities
includes the development of Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) and their
spatial component, Spatial Development Frameworks (SDFs). Since the
NBSAP 2005, much work has gone into developing tools for integrating
biodiversity considerations into local level planning through IDPs and SDFs.
Bioregional Plans provided for under the Biodiversity Act, or Biodiversity
Sector Plans, are key tools for municipalities and represent the biodiversity
sector’s input into the planning and development of other sectors, including
local government.
e —Intergovernmental structures are important to supporting cooperative governance

 

12
 between different organs of state. Those relevant to biodiversity include:

© Minister and Members of Executive Councils (MEC) Committees (known as
MINMEC), which is a forum that meets quarterly to promote co-operative
governance between the national ministers and their respective counterparts
at provincial level. The environmental MINMEC comprises the Minister of
Environmental Affairs, the Director-General of DEA and the provincial MECs
for Environmental Affairs (as mandated by Intergovernmental Relations
Framework Act (Act 13 of 2005)).

© Ministerial Technical Committees (MINTECH), which is a forum that meets
quarterly to facilitate coordination between DEA and the provincial
environmental departments. It comprises the Director-General of DEA,
representatives of public entities including SANBI and SANParks, and the
heads of the provincial departments responsible for environmental
management and biodiversity conservation (as mandated by
Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act of 2005).

o Aseries of MINTECH Working Groups (WG), which bring together senior
officials in national and provincial government, including working groups that
deal with Biodiversity and Conservation, Air Quality, Environmental Sector
Coordination and Information Management, Compliance and Enforcement,
Integrated Environmental Management/Authorisation, Job Creation and
EPWP, Oceans and Coasts, Waste and Chemical Management, Climate
Change, Law Reform and Policy Development, and Communications.

o _Interdepartmental Committee on Inland Water Ecosystems, which was
established in 2011 and brings together all organs of state relevant to the
management of freshwater ecosystems, including DEA, DWA, SANBI and
SANParks. This committee is a new development since the NBSAP 2005, and
is working well to increase the focus of government on freshwater
ecosystems and to clarify roles and responsibilities in relation to their
management.

o  Interdepartmental Project Implementation Committee (IPIC), which was
established with representation of DEA, DWA and the Department of Mineral
Resources (DMR), with the aim of ensuring aligned implementation of the
three Acts from which these departments draw their mandates, i.e. the
National Environmental Management Act of 1998, the National Water Act of
1998 and the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 2002.

o Regional Mining Development and Environmental Committee (RMDEC), which
was established in terms of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources
Development Act, 2002 (Act 28 of 2002) (MPRDA) in all the regions. The
Committee consists of members drawn from relevant Government
Departments or organs of State from National, Provincial and Local level. The
functions of the RMDEC includes advising the Minister on objections received
to the granting of a prospecting right, mining right or mining permit, and
considering objections regarding the environmental management
programmes or environmental management plans, reconnaissance
permissions, prospecting rights or mining permits and making
recommendations thereon to the Minister.

o Other cross-sector collaborations between various institutions catalysed as a
result of the Presidential Delivery Agreement (mentioned above).

e Anumber of public research organisations, many of which are established under
specific legislation, play a central role in supporting and funding research on issues
related to biodiversity conservation and management in South Africa. The National

13
 Research Foundation (NRF), established under the National Research Foundation Act
(Act No 23 of 1998), has a number of business units that work directly on biodiversity,
including the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB), the South
African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and the National Zoological
Gardens of South Africa (NZG). The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) is
established under the HSRC Act (No. 17 of 2008) to promote large-scale, policy-
relevant, social-scientific research “in the field of human sciences in order to improve
understanding of social conditions and the process of social change”. The Water
Research Council (WRC) is established under the Water Research Act (Act 34 of 1971)
to promote co-ordination, co-operation and communication in the area of water
research and development and receives its funding from water pricing. The Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC)
are similarly established by Acts of Parliament as science councils and are partly
funded through Parliamentary grants. Both organisations have large biodiversity-
related programmes of work.

e Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) play an important role in the biodiversity
sector in South Africa, including through accessing corporate funding which would
not be possible for government to access. NGOs are able to innovate and be flexible,
and often work in partnership with the public sector. Some of the biodiversity-related
NGOs active in South Africa include: African Conservation Trust (ACT), Birdlife South
Africa, Botanical Society of South Africa (BotSoc), Conservation South Africa (CSA),
affiliated with Conservation International, Delta Environment Centre (DEC), the
Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT), IUCN (International Union for Conservation of
Nature) South Africa, Lewis Foundation, National Association of Conservancies of
South Africa (NACSA), Peace Parks Foundation (PPF), Resource Africa South Africa ,
Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB), South
African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAMBR), Southern African Wildlife
College (SAWC), the Wilderness Foundation (WF), the Wildlands Conservation Trust,
Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA), and the World Wide Fund
for Nature South Africa (WWF-SA).

e Public-private partnerships and cooperative efforts relevant to biodiversity and
ecosystem management, of which, since the NBSAP 2005, there is a growing number
involving the state, private companies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and
the public. These multi-stakeholder cooperative efforts recognize that managing
biodiversity, particularly at an ecosystem level, requires interventions involving a
range of role players in different landscapes working together and sharing the
responsibility for biodiversity management. The growing number of examples
indicates an increasing appreciation of the relevance of biodiversity and the services
delivered from healthy, functioning ecosystems to governments, private companies,
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and the general public. Examples include
the National Biodiversity and Business Network (NBBN), some cases in the Business-
Adopt-A-Municipality programme, and the South African Sustainable Seafood Index
among many others. Environmental NGOs regularly play an important driving or
facilitating role in such partnerships.

Biodiversity-related expenditure

A recent figure from National Treasury on government expenditure on environment from

14
 2013/2014 was around R9.9 billion®.

Environmentally relevant public expenditures are expenditures by public institutions for
purposeful activities aimed at the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution or any
other degradation of the environment resulting from human activity, as well as natural
resource management activities not aimed at resource exploitation or production. This
includes allocations to national departments of environmental affairs, water and sanitation,
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, cooperative governance, energy, health, and science and
technology. Certain public entities receive, in addition to the direct allocations or transfers
from national departments, transfers from other government departments, own revenues
and other sources, which contributes billions of Rand to expenditure on environment. For
instance, for entities such as SANBI, SANParks and iSimangaliso Wetland Park, these
additional transfers amount to over R1.9 billion that is additional to the RO.5 billion allocated
from the line department.

In addition to public sector finance, the biodiversity sector has received substantial
investment through various donors and donor-funded projects, programmes or funds, such
as from the:

e Global Environment Facility (GEF) that funded the Cape Action for People and the
Environment project, the Agulhas Biodiversity Initiative (ABI), the Wild Coast project,
and the Grasslands Programme (all of which successfully leveraged additional funds

Further, private sector funds for biodiversity management and conservation are also
harnessed through public-private partnerships and NGOs. In many cases biodiversity
management and conservation is funded through layering of multiple funding sources.

Relationship to key development policies, strategies and plans, or
government-led programmes

A number of key development polices, strategies and plans express the possibilities
biodiversity presents to the development agenda. These provide opportunities for
mainstreaming biodiversity concerns into the national agenda. Two key documents are the
NDP and the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Action Plan (NSSDAP).

The NDP is a key over-arching plan that guides South Africa’s development path until 2030.

® This is a high level estimate of the allocations to National Departments and a snapshot of expenditure
allocations for 2013/2014.

15
 The NDP naturally places a strong emphasis on economic growth and development, with the
implication that environmental planning needs to be robust enough to secure biodiversity
from decisions driven largely by a development agenda. It recognises that some of our
development objectives are in conflict with each other, but affirms that South Africa “needs to
protect the natural environment in all respects, leaving subsequent generations with at least an
endowment of at least equal value’”®. The NDP therefore deals extensively with natural
resources and biodiversity across topics and content focused on tourism, agriculture and rural
development, economic infrastructure (water), and human settlements (spatial planning).

The NDP is partly being implemented through the National Infrastructure Plan (PICC, 2012),
which includes an initial set of 18 Strategic Integrated Projects (SIPS) and the enabling
Infrastructure Development Act (Act 23 of 2014). A possible 19" SIP, which is in the process
of being finalized and put forward for Cabinet endorsement, highlights the role of biodiversity
and ecosystems in the delivery of services through infrastructure by focusing investment on
ecological infrastructure to enhance water security.

The NSSDAP, endorsed by Cabinet in 2011, includes five strategic priorities that feature in the
NDP, and comprehensively covers content on biodiversity and ecological sustainability,
amongst other topics. Three of the strategic priorities reflect the need for sustaining healthy
ecosystems, sustainable utilisation of natural resources and the role of ecosystems in climate
change adaptation.

The New Growth Path was adopted in 2011 as a framework for economic policy and job
creation in South Africa. It sets out a series of strategies to build an economy capable of
sustained growth able to offer the jobs needed to address unemployment. The green
economy is recognised in the New Growth Path as one of the new economies able to
contribute towards this vision, with the potential to create an additional 300 000 jobs by
2020, and over 400 000 by 2030. Many of these jobs will come through the management of
biodiversity and ecological infrastructure. The Green Economy Accord outlines in more detail
government’s commitments to the green economy.

A recent initiative designed to address critical development issues highlighted in the NDP
2030 is Operation Phakisa. Operation Phakisa is focused on implementing priority
programmes that will unlock the South Africa’s economic potential in a way that helps to
address poverty and unemployment. Operation Phakisa is initially implemented in two
sectors, the ocean economy and health, and will be rolled out in other sectors. In the oceans
economy four priority areas for unlocking the oceans economy through inclusive economic
growth have been identified, one of which is marine protection services and ocean
governance.

Other biodiversity and sustainable development relevant government policies and plans
include:

e National Biodiversity Economy Strategy (NBES), being developed by DEA.

e South African National Man and Biosphere Strategy (currently under development),
coordinated by the South African Man and Biosphere National Committee, of which
DEA is the focal point.

e World Heritage Convention Act (49 of 1999) and appropriate reviews of management
performance for World Heritage Sites undertaken by UNESCO (e.g. 2014).

e Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (Act 16 of 2013).

e Policy on approval for siting, management and supply of resources (e.g. coal) to

e Municipal Finance Act and municipal finance support (such as the Cities Support
Programme), and finance and planning policy reform initiatives.

e A “Discussion Document towards an Anti-Poverty Strategy for South Africa” which
takes cognisance of the important role that healthy ecosystems play in sustainable
development.

e National Framework for Sustainable Development, which recognises the important
role that healthy ecosystems play in sustainable development.

e The National Climate Change Response Strategy and National Action Programme for
Combating Land Degradation which both incorporate biodiversity related matters.

A number of large, cross-sectoral government-led programmes have been initiated in South
Africa during the past decade, which focus on sustainable development, job creation and
poverty alleviation. Examples include the Working for Water, Working for Wetlands, LandCare
and Integrated Sustainable Rural Development programmes. These present important
opportunities to mainstream biodiversity considerations into development planning, capacity
building and community empowerment. They also highlight the tremendous potential that
investing in biodiversity and ecological infrastructure holds for job creation and service
delivery in South Africa’s economy.

South Africa’s biodiversity

South Africa ranks as the third most biologically diverse country in the world, and contains
three of the world’s 34 biodiversity hotspots — the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Hotspot,
the Cape Floristic Region and the Succulent Karoo.

South Africa is recognised for its species diversity and endemism as well as its diversity of
ecosystems. These diverse ecosystems deliver ecosystem services that are of benefit to
people including the provision of basic services and goods such as clean air, water, food,
medicine and fibre; as well as more complex services that regulate and mitigate our climate,
protect us from natural disaster and provide us with a rich heritage of nature-based cultural
traditions. Naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver these valuable services to people are
known as ecological infrastructure. These rich endowments of biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure provide immense opportunity to support South Africa’s
development path and play an important role in underpinning the economy.

Understanding our biodiversity, how it supports development and human well-being and how
it is impacted by development activities is important in unlocking the value of biodiversity and
ecosystems in support of the country’s development path. While biodiversity is essentially
everywhere, some areas are more important than others in terms of the biodiversity that
occurs there. South Africa has a relatively long history of assessing aspects of biodiversity and
ecosystems through good spatial and non-spatial biodiversity information and experienced
systematic biodiversity assessment and planning specialists. This has resulted in a knowledge
base on biodiversity that continues to grow, the identification of priority areas for biodiversity
management and conservation (often referred to as biodiversity priority areas), and
assessments of the status and trends of biodiversity.

The first assessment of South Africa’s biodiversity across terrestrial, river, estuarine and
marine environments was done in 2004. With assessments done every 5 to 7 years, the 2011
assessment included advances in mapping and classifying ecosystems, such as the inclusion of
wetland ecosystems and areas important for climate change resilience, advances in inclusion
of species of special concern and invasive alien species, amongst other things. The National
Biodiversity Assessment is led by SANBI in partnership with a wide range of organisations,

17
 involving participation from stakeholders, scientists and biodiversity management experts. It
is critical to informing the revision and updating of key national biodiversity policies and
strategies, including the NBSAP, NBF and National Protected Area Expansion Strategy
(NPAES). The NBA and its underlying information is used to streamline environmental
decision-making, strengthen land-use planning, strengthen strategic planning about optimal
development futures for South Africa, and identify priorities for management and restoration
of ecosystems with related opportunities for ecosystem-based job creation. Since the NBSAP
2005, biodiversity information has been deeply integrated into development planning
systems and processes.

South Africa’s biodiversity is assessed across terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and
marine ecosystems, using two national ecosystem indicators, namely ecosystem threat status
and ecosystem protection level. The ecosystem threat status in the NBA 2011 highlighted that
wetland ecosystems are the most threatened ecosystems in South Africa (see Figure 99) and
the ecosystem protection level highlights that wetland and offshore ecosystems have the
highest proportion of ecosystem types that are not protected (see Figure 10).

Both of these indicators has direct links to policy. Examples include the listing of threatened
ecosystems in terms of the Biodiversity Act, and the identification of ecosystems in need of
protection, which informs the expansion of South Africa’s protected area network and
priority areas for conservation action. The biodiversity stewardship approach is an
increasingly favoured mechanism being used for the expansion of the protected area network
and the conservation estate (see Figure 111).

Biodiversity stewardship is an approach to protect and manage land in biodiversity priority areas
that is led by conservation authorities entering into legal agreements with private and communal
landowners. It recognises landowners as the custodians of biodiversity on their land and is based
on voluntary commitments from landowners, with a range of different types of biodiversity
stewardship agreements some involving formally declared as protected areas in terms of the
Protected Areas Act, others secured in terms of the Biodiversity Act or contract law. It has proven
to be a cost-effective mechanism for expanding the protected area network and making a
significant contribution to meeting national protected area targets. In biodiversity stewardship
areas that do not involve a formal declaration in terms of the Protected Areas Act, such as those
where a Biodiversity Management Agreement governed by the Biodiversity Act or a Biodiversity
Agreement bound by a contract exist, the development of biodiversity management plans is
contributing to better management of biodiversity outside of protected areas.

Figure 11. Biodiversity Stewardship in South Africa

A growing knowledge base, built on ongoing research and monitoring, is highlighting certain
ecosystems as high-value ecological infrastructure that provide critical ecosystem services.
These include wetlands that provide water purification and flood regulation, strategic water
source areas that are of strategic importance for water security, healthy river tributaries that
help to improve and maintain water quality and quantity, estuaries that provide important
nursery areas for marine fish and invertebrates including commercially harvested ones, and
coastal and inshore marine ecosystems that help to buffer the impacts of climate change. An
emerging focus on this ecological infrastructure is helping to unlock investment in South
Africa’s ecosystems, with multiple social, environmental and economic benefits.

South Africa has over 95 000 known species. Species of plants, animals, birds, fish, frogs,
reptiles, molluscs, insects and fungi are the building blocks of ecosystems. Some of these
species are referred to as species of special concern, having particular ecological, economic or
cultural significance. Examples include medicinal plants, harvested marine species or

19
 threatened species. Conservation assessments of species, or Red Lists, use an internationally
agreed set of criteria to assess the threat levels of different species, based on the likelihood
of extinction. South Africa has a dedicated Threatened Species Programme and is a world
leader in Red Listing, having assessed a wider range of taxonomic groups than most countries,
and being the only mega-diverse country to have assessed its entire flora. Results from Red
List assessments show that the proportion of threatened species is highest for freshwater fish
and inland mammals but the highest number of threatened species is found in the plant
group. Knowledge gaps with respect to the conservation status of species in South Africa exist
for marine and invertebrate species. These assessments link to policy such as the regulations
for Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) and the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) published in terms of the Biodiversity Act.

Pressures on biodiversity

Analyses based on assessments of the status and trends of species and ecosystems highlight
key pressures on South Africa’s biodiversity that are as a result of multiple interacting drivers
of change.

Rates of loss and degradation of natural habitat, in terrestrial, freshwater and marine
environments is high in some parts of the country (such as in Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal and
North West Province) and is the primary threat to species. For species the issue is not simply
the loss of individual patches of natural vegetation but also the resulting fragmentation of the
remaining natural vegetation, which is a problem especially for species that need large areas
of natural habitat to survive and those that cannot move easily between remaining patches of
habitat. Fragmentation also prevents landscape-scale ecological processes, such as fire, from
functioning effectively.

The drivers of loss and degradation of natural habitat vary across these areas, but the major
drivers at a national level include conversion to cultivation and over-grazing in terrestrial and
wetland ecosystems, invasive alien species in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, coastal
development in coastal ecosystems, certain fishing activities, such as trawling, in marine
ecosystems, and mining in all ecosystems. Maps of biodiversity priority areas are especially
important for guiding land and marine use decisions about where to locate development,
especially in these areas.

Alterations to the timing and quantity of river flows, for example as a result of dams, transfer
schemes between catchments, or poor catchment management, are major pressures faced
by rivers and wetland ecosystems. Pollutants and sediments from surrounding landscapes is a
serious and growing problem to aquatic ecosystems, river and wetland ecosystems in
particular. Other pressures on wetland ecosystems include cultivation, urban development,
mining, and poor grazing management. Over-utilisation of biodiversity assets, especially in the
marine environment, invasive alien species in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems,
and climate change pose additional impacts on biodiversity.

The underlying drivers of these pressures are related chiefly to patterns of consumption and
production, often for the benefit of the relatively wealthy. Unfortunately it is frequently the
poor or vulnerable who bear the socio-economic and cultural implications of impacts on
biodiversity. Examples of some of the implications of impacts on biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure include:

e Degradation or loss of the ability of ecological infrastructure to provide services that
are essential for supporting built infrastructure, contributing to water security and
food security, and reducing the risk of disasters such as floods and droughts. For
instance, the impact of invasive alien plant species on ecosystem services is

20
 estimated to be a massive R6.5 billion worth of ecosystem services lost annually. If it
were not for programmes like Working for Water, which clears these invasive species,
the value of lost ecosystem services per year would be six times higher (Van Wilgen
et al. 2008).

Well managed and well functioning ecosystems are likely to play an important role in
enhancing resilience to the impacts of climate change, including buffering human
settlements and activities from the impacts of extreme climate events.
Loss of livelihoods through impacts to biodiversity assets that many South Africans
depend on directly or indirectly for production, trade or consumption. For example, it
is estimated that between 9 and 12 million people in impoverished rural areas
directly use natural resources such as fuel wood, wild fruits and wooden utensils as a
source of energy, food and building material respectively (Shackleton 2004). It is also
estimated that 27 million South Africans use traditional medicine as a form of health
care, and that more than 133 000 people are employed through the utilisation of
more than 2000 plant species for traditional medicinal purposes, which generates
approximately R2.9 billion a year (Mander et al. 2007). Further, the value of the use
of indigenous plants species in personal hygiene products, cosmetics, complementary
medicines, food flavourants and essential oil products is estimated to be between
R41 million and R57 million per year (DEA 2012).
Impacts to food security, as agriculture is intricately dependent on biodiversity in
many ways. Examples include the dependence on water for irrigation that is
supported by healthy catchments, reliance of some cultivated crops on wild
pollinators (an ecosystem service worth millions of rand a year to the Western Cape’s
deciduous fruit industry (Allsopp et al. 2008)), and provision of natural grazing areas
for the livestock industry.
Tourism relies significantly on biodiversity assets, the protected area network being a
significant draw for tourists, generating numerous employment opportunities and
contributing millions of Rand a year to South Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
An emerging wildlife industry, game ranching including hunting, is estimated to
generate a further R7.7 billion a year and creates 100 000 jobs.
Implications for livelihoods linked to estuaries, coastal and marine ecosystems, for
instance to local communities in areas surrounding the great St Lucia Lake system
who currently harvest reeds and sedges worth over R4.7 million every year (Collings,
2009) or to communities that benefit from estuarine or inshore marine fisheries, the
total value of which was estimated to be R1.2 billion per year in 2011 (Van Niekerk
and Turpie 2012). Similarly, commercial fisheries in marine habitats were valued in
2010 at approximately R6 billion and employed about 27 000 people. A further 28
000 households were estimated to be practising subsistence fishing (DAFF 2012).

 

 

The implications of impacts on biodiversity highlight the importance of avoiding loss or
degradation of natural habitat in priority areas, which support well-functioning landscapes
and seascapes in the long term, and which in turn are able to support a range of social and
economic activity.

These findings from the NBA — knowing where our important biodiversity is, and what drivers
are exerting pressure on it across landscapes — are vital informants in identifying the strategic
objectives, outcomes and actions around which South Africa’s NBSAP is framed.

24,
 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan

Conceptual framework of the NBSAP

South Africa’s approach to biodiversity management is informed by a number of important
conceptual elements which are reflected in the NBSAP.

Like South Africa’s legislative and policy framework for biodiversity, the revised NBSAP is
based on the fact that biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure directly underpin
development and human well-being and offer immense potential support to the country’s
development path, including enhancing resilience to global change. This is enabled by taking
a landscape approach to working in partnerships across land- and seascapes to conserve,
restore and sustainably use biodiversity, while enabling sustainable economic development,
rural development, job creation and livelihoods. Building on this, recognizing that most of
South Africa’s important biodiversity is found outside protected areas, the need to
mainstream biodiversity considerations into the policies, strategies and practices of other
sectors is core to achieving national biodiversity targets.

The landscape approach and biodiversity mainstreaming necessitates that the revised NBSAP
is informed by knowledge, including science-based and indigenous knowledge, that tell us
what biodiversity we have, where it is and what state it is in. Policies, planning and
management practices that are informed by relevant knowledge are critical to a robust
strategy. This approach results in an integrated strategy that links to a range of different
sectors which, at the level of implementation depends on effective cooperative governance
across all spheres of government, amongst departments and other organisations. As an
integrated strategy with explicit links and synergies between the strategies and plans of the
biodiversity and other sectors, shared ownership of the NBSAP is thus an important
component of its development and implementation.

The NBSAP seeks to play a transformative role in building capacity in the biodiversity sector, in
optimizing the biodiversity economy in support of sustainable rural development, and in
reducing the vulnerability of often poor and marginalized communities through strategic
investments in ecological infrastructure that enhance the resilience of ecosystems. The
revised NBSAP also builds on what has been achieved in the past 10 years. It lays a framework
for adaptive approaches to management through research, planning and decision-making that
is informed by emerging knowledge foundations and responds to emerging pressures on
biodiversity or opportunities. The revised NBSAP aligns with what is in the strategic plans of
key stakeholders to deliver an action-driven, practical and prioritized NBSAP for the short-
term, while ensuring that the management, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity
over the long-term. The NBSAP is an inclusive strategy that respects, preserves, and maintains
traditional knowledge, innovations and practices. In so doing, the revised NBSAP seeks to
align with South Africa’s Constitution, national development priorities and with the objectives,
principles and targets of the CBD.

Structure of the NBSAP

The core strategy of South Africa’s revised NBSAP is illustrated in Figure 12 below. At a high
level, the strategy is framed by an overarching vision which outlines the long-term vision for
the state of biodiversity in the country. Six strategic objectives reflect the most pressing
issues that the NBSAP seeks to address. Each strategic objective is comprised of several
outcomes, which are the priorities within each strategic objective. Each outcome is then
broken down into a number of different activities. The logic underpinning the strategy and

22
 action plan is that the implementation of the activities will collectively result in the
achievement of the outcome, which in turn collectively contribute towards the achievement
of the strategic objective.

Figure 12. Summary of the National Biodiversity Strategy

Principles

This NBSAP is informed by principles that are distilled from those articulated in South Africa’s
constitution and the framework legislation for the environmental sector, the National
Environmental Management Act (NEMA) (No. 107 of 1998). Further, their articulation in this
strategy is informed by overarching priorities and objectives articulated in the NDP, NSSDAP,
Biodiversity Act, National Biodiversity Economy Strategy (NBES), and the White Paper on the
Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa’s Biological Diversity (1997). These
principles are:

1. A people-centred approach to biodiversity, recognising that the well-being of South
Africa’s people is dependent on the well-being of the environment.

2. Biodiversity contributes to sustainable development

Sustainable use of biodiversity promotes social development and economic growth.

4. Mainstreaming of awareness of the value and importance of biodiversity across
society

5. The biodiversity sector contributes to the transformation of South Africa to a more
equitable society.

w

NEMA articulates a people-centred approach to environmental management: “Environmental

23
 management must place people and their needs at the forefront of its concern, and serve
their physical, psychological, developmental, cultural and social interests equitably”. The
substantive principles articulated in the NSSDAP include the statement that “socioeconomic
systems are embedded in and dependent on ecosystems”. Strategic Objectives 1 and 2 of the
revised NBSAP are concerned with enhancing the contribution of biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure to sustainable development of a resilient economy and society.

South Africa’s NSSDAP (2011 — 2014) states: “sustainable development implies the selection
and implementation of a development option, which allows for appropriate and justifiable
social and economic goals to be achieved, based on the meeting of basic needs and equity,
without compromising the natural system on which it is based”. Strategic Objective 3 of the
NBSAP seeks to ensure that biodiversity considerations are mainstreamed into policy and
planning decisions, to ensure that development is ecologically sustainable.

Strategic Objective 3 of the NBSAP needs to be understood within the context of the
principles of “Full Cost-Benefit Accounting”, and “Informed and Transparent Decision-
Making” articulated in the White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South
Africa’s Biological Diversity.

The first guiding principle stated in the White Paper is: “All life forms and ecological systems
have intrinsic value.” Systematic biodiversity planning needs to be based on a recognition of
the intrinsic value of biodiversity across generations, as asserted in the NDP 2030, which
recognises the need to: "protect the natural environment in all respects, leaving subsequent
generations with at least an endowment of at least equal value”.

The White Paper, NEMA and the NSSDAP stress the importance of sustainable use of natural
resources — from NEMA: “...the development, use and exploitation of renewable resources
and the ecosystems of which they are part do not exceed the resources that are necessary for
long-term survival are not destroyed for short term gain”. Ensuring effective knowledge
foundations are in place to ensure that biodiversity is used sustainably is central to the
purpose of Strategic Objective 6 of the revised NBSAP.

NEMA stresses both the importance of an integrated approach to environmental
management and the need for awareness of the environment: “community wellbeing and
empowerment must be promoted through environmental education, the raising of
environmental awareness, the sharing of knowledge and experience and other appropriate
means”. An underlying theme in the revised NBSAP is the need for mainstreaming of
biodiversity, based on greater awareness of its value and socioeconomic contribution.
Strategic Objective 4 is concerned with effecting behaviour change to ensure sustainable use
and conservation of biodiversity.

The principles articulated in NEMA frame a transformative agenda for the environmental
sector, including: “equitable access to environmental resources, benefits and services to
meet basic human needs and ensure human wellbeing must be pursued and special
measures may be taken to ensure access thereto by categories of persons disadvantaged by
unfair discrimination”. This is to guide the development of an equitable and suitably skilled
workforce for biodiversity conservation and management, as envisaged in Strategic Objective
5, as well as informing the manner in which the benefits derived from sustainable use of
biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure are allocated.

Vision

Conserve, manage and sustainably use biodiversity to ensure equitable benefits to the people
of South Africa, now and in the future.

National Action Plan

The action plan of the NBSAP breaks down each strategic objective into a comprehensive set
of outcomes (summarised in Table 2). These outcomes are the priorities for the strategic
objective.

This is followed by more detailed descriptions of each of the strategic objectives and their
outcomes and a breakdown of the activities that address each outcome.

The description of each outcome is followed by a table listing the activities, with lead and
support organisations involved in each activity, and the priority level of that activity. Activities
were prioritised as high, medium or low according to their importance in achieving the
outcome and secondly whether they were likely to receive funding or already were funded.

Outcome level indicators and targets are also provided in the tables for each outcome. As far
as possible, the indicators and targets have been drawn from existing national or
organizational strategic plans in South Africa. This has served two functions. While serving as
a means to track progress towards implementing the NBSAP, the indicators and targets also
enable alignment between the NBSAP and South Africa’s development imperatives. This has
ensured that the NBSAP is firmly integrated and aligned with the strategic priorities and plans
of major role players in South Africa and therefore represents a common vision and plan for
biodiversity management. More information about monitoring and evaluation is provided in
the section on Institutional Coordination and Monitoring.

 SO 1. Management of biodiversity assets and their contribution to the economy, rural development, job creation and social wellbeing is
enhanced.

Biodiversity assets are species, ecosystems and other biodiversity-related resources that generate ecosystem services, support livelihoods, and provide a
foundation for economic growth, social development and human wellbeing, both now and in the future. Management of biodiversity assets in this strategic
objective includes their effective conservation and sustainable use.

South Africa’s significant wealth in biodiversity assets needs sound management and conservation to ensure their contribution to the economy, rural
development, job creation and social well-being now and in the future. This includes effective management of a network of protected areas and conservation
areas comprising a representative sample of the ecosystems and species that occur in South Africa (Outcome 1.1), and sustainably managing species of
special concern (which play an important role in maintaining well-functioning ecosystems and have particular ecological, economic or cultural significance)
(Outcome 1.2). It also requires expanding, strengthening and transforming the biodiversity economy to optimise economic opportunities in a way that is
inclusive of the rural poor and supports local economic development that is sustainable over the long term (Outcome 1.3).

Sustainable management and use is emphasized as overexploitation of many species and ecosystems remains a major threat to biodiversity. Sustainable use
means using biodiversity assets in a manner that avoids their degradation or depletion (at a rate that allows for renewal). This requires managing biodiversity
assets in a manner that also ensures their resilience to pressures of climate change, invasive alien species and other inter-connected elements of global
change. Doing so is an essential aspect of management effectiveness and ensuring sustainability in a manner that will support the land reform agenda and
socio-economic opportunities for communal land holders (Outcome 1.4).

1.1 The network of protected areas and conservation areas includes a representative sample of ecosystems and species, and is coherent and effectively
managed

This outcome seeks to secure a representative sample of ecosystems and species (biodiversity assets) in a network of protected areas and conservation areas
that may be managed by government, private or communal landowners. Protected areas and conservation areas have specific meanings in South Africa that
stems from the legislation used to secure the land or sea, not the ownership of the land. In other words, protected areas and conservation areas can be
owned and managed by government, communal and private landowners. Protected areas are areas of land or sea that are formally declared through the
Protected Areas Act (No. 57 of 2003) and are managed mainly for biodiversity conservation. These areas form part of the protected area estate. Conservation
areas are areas that are not formally protected by the Protected Areas Act but are nevertheless managed at least partly for biodiversity conservation. They
contribute to the broader conservation estate.

South Africa has made progress in increasing the protection of biodiversity, particularly the extent of land-based protection, but there remain unprotected

27
 and under-protected ecosystems and species. Offshore marine ecosystems are the most poorly protected ecosystems of all South Africa’s ecosystems,
followed by wetland ecosystem types, rivers, then coastal and inshore ecosystems. The expansion of protected areas to include a representative sample of
ecosystems and species is still needed, particularly with respect to allowing for ecosystem responses to climate change and incorporating the network of

Important Biodiversity and Bird Areas.

Expansion is guided by the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy, which
focuses on consolidating and expanding the protected area network as well as
strengthening the management of existing protected areas. This strategy must be
updated to take into account the impacts of various key drivers of change, such as
changing weather patterns and invasive alien species, and emerging issues related
to the growing range of property owners responsible for managing protected
areas.

Biodiversity stewardship programmes have significantly supported protected area
expansion (at much lower cost to the state than land acquisition) as well as
improved management of biodiversity priority areas outside protected areas.
Strengthening the institutional capacity of biodiversity stewardship programmes
and the suite of incentives (such as access to technical expertise) for biodiversity
stewardship is critical to enhancing their contribution to protected area and
conservation area expansion. With modest increases in resources, biodiversity
stewardship programmes could make an even larger contribution, including in
supporting the land reform agenda and socio-economic opportunities for
communal land-owners (see outcome 1.4). Management effectiveness in
protected areas and in conservation areas will also support achievement of
biodiversity objectives, enhanced socio-economic benefits and climate change
resilience.

Only ecosystems and species in the protected area estate count towards
the achievement of targets for the protection of a representative sample
of ecosystems and species. This is because the conservation of biodiversity
on these areas is attached to the title deed of the land or sea and is
binding on the property. Although this is not the case in conservation

areas (i.e. conservation is not legally binding on the property), many
conservation areas make a significant contribution to the conservation of
biodiversity assets outside of protected areas.

Biodiversity stewardship provides mechanisms through which these
contributions to both the protected area estate and the conservation
estate can be secured. Biodiversity stewardship involves voluntary
commitments from landowners (government, communal or private)
through different types of agreements with conservation authorities to
protect and manage land in biodiversity priority areas. Contributions to
the conservation estate include Biodiversity Management Agreements
governed by the Biodiversity Act or Biodiversity Agreements bound by
contracts. Other types of biodiversity stewardship include those that
result in protection of land under the Protected Areas Act.

Figure 13. Protected areas, the conservation estate and biodiversity stewardship

In many cases, protected areas and conservation areas are contiguous, and in some cases extend over administrative boundaries, national borders or
different management authorities. The contiguous nature of these relatively large natural areas enhances the management of biodiversity assets and their
contribution to the economy, rural development, job creation and social wellbeing, particularly if their management is coordinated through the formation of
a Biosphere Reserve or Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCA). TFCAs and Biosphere Reserves seek to conserve important transboundary ecosystems and
support the socio-economic development in these areas. Strategies that provide strategic direction for enhanced management of these areas, such as the

28
 South African National Man and the Biosphere Strategy currently under development, should be supported by enhanced inter-agency cooperation. Access
and benefit sharing from protected areas, and conservation areas such as in Biosphere Reserves and TFCAs, needs to be strengthened as an important part of
realising the full potential of these areas to contributing to national, provincial local development priorities. These are core areas for the provision of a range
of economic, social, cultural and spiritual benefits that support biodiversity economies (Outcome 1.3).

In some cases there will be certain species that are critically endangered and require protection currently outside of protected areas at one site in order to
avoid habitat loss and risk of extinction.

1.2 Species of special concern are sustainably managed

Species are the building blocks of ecosystems. They play an important role in maintaining well-functioning ecosystems and thus in supporting the provision of
ecosystem services. Species of special concern are those that have particular ecological, economic or cultural significance. They include species that are
harvested from the wild (including medicinal plants and harvested marine species), threatened species (e.g. cycads), food plants (e.g. wild crop relatives),
keystone species (e.g. rhino), species that provide the basis for non-consumptive ecotourism (e.g. whales, sharks, seabirds and turtles), and species that are
an important part of cultural and religious practices. Many of these species become over-harvested, or suffer habitat loss, which threatens their persistence.

In the last 10 years South Africa’s achievements in addressing the protection and sustainable management of these species have included the publication of
new, and amendments to various existing, norms and standards, regulations, and guidelines published and implemented in terms of the Biodiversity Act
(developing, implementing, reviewing and updating of legislative and other tools that ensure the protection of species is dealt with in Outcome 3.6). Included
in this are the Norms and Standards for Biodiversity Management Plans for Species (BMP-S) and the subsequent publication in terms of the Biodiversity Act of
Biodiversity Management Plans for several species of special concern. While developing, implementing, reviewing and updating of legislative and other tools
that ensure the protection of species is dealt with in Outcome 3.6, the development, implementation and sustainably funding of BMP-S and recovery plans
(rehabilitation programmes) for species that are being unsustainably harvested is key to sustainable management of species of special concern. Investing in
sustainable management and efficient use of species of special concern, particularly marine living resources, can make a significant contribution to job
creation and sustainable livelihoods, while improving the environment and protecting indigenous genetic resources.

Another important activity in achieving this outcome is maintaining an effective Scientific Authority that monitors the legal and illegal trade in species listed as

30
 threatened or protected (in terms of section 56 of the Biodiversity Act) and species included on the Appendices to CITES, and makes recommendations to an
issuing authority on applications for permits to trade in these species. The Scientific Authority also makes and publishes non-detriment findings (NDFs) on the
impact of trade on the survival of species in the wild and advises on the registration of ranching operations, nurseries, and captive breeding facilities.

In some cases, ex situ conservation is and will become necessary for the conservation of certain species to address impacts such as unsustainable use, habitat
transformation or climate change. Integrated programmes to support sustainable use may include propagation programmes (including captive breeding and
cultivation of wild species) to relieve pressure of harvesting, and may also include multi-species approaches for addressing links in legal and illegal trade of
different species (or parts thereof, such as rhino horn). The need for such integrated programmes, ex situ conservation programmes, and recovery plans for
certain species to address the management and protection of species of special concern highlights the challenges for sustainably managing species over the
next 10 years, requires sustainable funding and coordination of efforts by stakeholders to work effectively towards this Outcome.

 1.3 The biodiversity economy is expanded, strengthened and transformed to be more inclusive of the rural poor

Biodiversity is recognised as fundamental to economic growth and sustainable development. Growing sustainable, inclusive and transformed biodiversity
economies with communities is a priority for South Africa. Biodiversity economies focus on developing economic opportunities linked to biodiversity assets
that support local economic development that is not harmful to biodiversity. The biodiversity economy has the potential to support a range of business and
employment opportunities that promote alternative productive land uses and sustainable utilisation of biodiversity, especially in rural areas, such as through
biotrade and bioprospecting, the wildlife and marine wildlife sectors, and ecotourism.

While there is a growing biodiversity economy in South Africa it requires coordination and leadership to avoid fragmented developmental interventions and
to harness the benefits in a way that is inclusive, transformative and sustainable. Towards this, DEA, in consultation with other stakeholders, has developed
National Biodiversity Economy Strategies (NBES) for the natural products sector and the wildlife sector to advance South Africa’s biodiversity economy over
the next 10 years. The objectives of the NBES are to provide national coordination, leadership and guidance on the commercialisation and trade of
biodiversity assets, to promote and support the sustainable commercial use of such biodiversity, to contribute to the transformation of the biodiversity
economy sector, and to establish facilities for the promotion and enhancement of the use of such biodiversity.

The NBES identifies biodiversity economy transformation (BET) nodes to focus efforts of various partners in the development of prosperous and sustainable
biodiversity economies that supports social and economic development, biodiversity economy transformation, poverty alleviation, and job creation. These
nodes are informed by, amongst other criteria, the Presidential Poverty Nodes for government action, the areas prioritised by the DRDLR, and local economic
development (LED) imperatives of local and provincial government.

Although the existing NBES address tourism, a strategy to sustainably optimise the biodiversity-based tourism sector is needed to build on ecotourism
opportunities linked to biodiversity assets, such as protected areas, TFCAs and Biosphere Reserves. Additionally, these strategies are predominantly focused
on biodiversity assets in terrestrial ecosystems, extending to freshwater ecosystems as relevant. Strategies to address the sustainable optimisation the marine
wildlife sector is also necessary (under Operation Phakisa, marine protection is seen as a key priority for unlocking the ocean economy).

1.4 Biodiversity conservation supports the land reform agenda and socio-economic opportunities for communal land holders

The management and conservation of biodiversity assets has the potential to support land reform and create socio-economic opportunities for communal
land holders in support of local economic development. While there are close links between this outcome and others, the focus of this outcome is on the
mechanisms and actions for addressing the specific context of land reform and conservation.

This includes strengthening the Land Reform and Biodiversity Stewardship Initiative (LRBSI), a tripartite initiative between DRDLR, DEA and SANBI that started
in 2008. It functions as a community of practice focusing on land reform, communal lands, and biodiversity stewardship to demonstrate successful delivery of
socio-economic and conservation benefits at specific sites and develop guidelines, strategies and plans to support scaling up successful practices. The
initiative should be strengthened to fulfil its mandate and reinforce linkages to other programmes that support land holders, such as support to emerging
farmers through the DEA Land User Incentives programme.

Settlement of land claims in protected areas remains a priority, as does the role of the People and Parks Programme in achieving its mission of supporting
biodiversity conservation through the creation and rehabilitation of infrastructure in and around protected areas for community beneficiation, including
through facilitating the resolution of protected area land claims. Biodiversity stewardship is an important mechanism through which socio-economic

33
 opportunities for communal land owners, including those on restituted land, can be supported. Biodiversity stewardship programmes play an important role
in this regard, demonstrating that conservation can work hand in hand with land reform and support rural livelihoods (links to Outcome 1.1).

 SO 2. Investments in ecological infrastructure enhance resilience and ensure benefits to society

Ecological infrastructure”° refers to naturally functioning ecosystems, such as wetlands, healthy mountain catchments and rivers that deliver valuable services
to people. These ecosystems play as important a role as built infrastructure in providing services and underpinning South Africa’s socio-economic
development.

Drivers of change, such as the spread of invasive alien species, land degradation and changing weather patterns due to climate change, impact on the ability
of ecological infrastructure to provide essential services, which influences human health and welfare. Investments in the maintenance, restoration and
protection of ecological infrastructure enhances the resilience of ecosystems to better withstand pressures from climate change, including buffering human
settlements from the impacts of extreme climate events, and to deliver basic services such as clean water (Outcome 2.1). Investing in ecological infrastructure
also protects and enhances built infrastructure, supports rural development and creates jobs. This work does not require the development of new
mechanisms or instruments. It involves identifying priority ecological infrastructure, engaging organisations that would benefit from or have a key
responsibility for investing in these ecosystems, and integrating ecological infrastructure into existing practices, programmes of work and institutional
structures, such as planning, mapping, restoration and partnerships between the state and private landowners.

The ecosystem services that are currently the focus of investment in South Africa are those related to water and disaster risk reduction, with climate change
adaptation elements in both of these. The use of biodiversity and ecosystem services (such as those delivered by ecological infrastructure) as part of an
overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change is called ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (Outcome 2.2) and is part
of enhancing resilience of people and the economy to climate change (highlighted as a need in the NDP). This strategic objective seeks to harness the
potential of both ecological infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaption as two approaches that deliver multiple services and benefits across landscapes in
the context of sustainable development, and contribute to the wellbeing of society.

2.1 Restore, maintain and secure important ecological infrastructure in a way that contributes to rural development, long-term job creation and
livelihoods

The notion of investing in ecological infrastructure represents a new approach to understanding and communicating the core intention of maintaining and
restoring natural ecosystems that provide valuable services. The shift from communicating about ecosystem services to communicating the concept of
ecological infrastructure (which can be understood as the source of the service) has taken place in the past few years. It is related to the fact that ecological
infrastructure is a more tangible concept, allows focus on discrete elements in the landscape, and builds on the notion that, like ‘built’ infrastructure,

1° References drawn from in this section include SANBI (2014 d,e) and RSA (2014).

35
 ecological infrastructure requires investment through proper management, maintenance and sometimes restoration to ensure long-term returns. Ecological
infrastructure has already been integrated into institutional structures, programmes of work and practices such as planning, mapping and restoration. A
number of landscape level partnership initiatives have been formed towards the improved management of ecological infrastructure for the services it
delivers.

Investment in ecological infrastructure should however focus on spatially strategic and systematically identified areas. Best available biodiversity information
and spatial biodiversity planning methods should be used to provide the basis for mapping and prioritising ecological infrastructure, recognising that priority
ecological infrastructure may vary according to the particular service that is of interest. For example, a map of priority ecological infrastructure supporting
water services may identify different landscape features compared to a map of priority ecological infrastructure for disaster risk reduction. Prioritisation
methods should include both ecological and socio-economic factors, considering the beneficiaries and the providers of the ecosystem services. Such
prioritization should guide planning of investments in ecological infrastructure, such as through the DEA NRM programmes, and efforts to scale up restoration
and maintenance of ecological infrastructure. It should also guide efforts to secure ecological infrastructure, such as strategic water source areas or important
marine ecological infrastructure that are best managed under appropriate legal protection.

As water-related services are a primary focus of investing in ecological infrastructure, there is a need for strong alignment with the National Water Resource
Strategy and the Water Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Roadmap. Similarly, agriculture and rural development policies and their
implementation should align with ecological infrastructure priorities, in order to ensure that ecological infrastructure support the scale up of agriculture and
rural development initiatives (linking to Outcome 3.6 of the NBSAP).

2.2 Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is shown to achieve multiple benefits in the context of sustainable development

The concept of ecosystem-based adaptation, being “the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to
adapt to the adverse effects of climate change” first emerged through a CBD Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Biodiversity and Climate Change (AHTEG) in
2009. As with the notion of ecological infrastructure, EbA recognizes that biodiversity and healthy, well-functioning ecosystems provide natural solutions that
build resilience and help society adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. EbA is intended to simultaneously deliver direct and tangible benefits to
targeted communities, be beneficial for the environment, and help to safeguard development in the face of climate change. This kind of investment can
target efforts to lessen flooding, improve water and soil quality, shore up food security, and contribute to human health, safer and more secure livelihoods
(especially for the poor and vulnerable), job creation and poverty alleviation.

Since 2009, the concept of EbA as a means of adapting to climate change and achieving multiple benefits has gained traction and various international

processes have called for countries to pilot and share case studies of EbA implementation. In 2013, DEA requested SANBI to provide science-based policy

37
 advice on the development of biodiversity and climate change adaptation implementation plans in support of DEA’s broader programme of work on
biodiversity and climate change. Over the next 10 years, the development of an overarching implementation plan (building on the processes and
recommendations of the DEA report entitled ‘Climate Change Adaptation Plans for South African Biomes, 2015) are needed to guide ecosystem-based
adaptation that delivers multiple benefits across South Africa’s biomes.

This Outcome requires bringing together various actors to implement projects at the municipal or local level, document lessons and showcase results in
support of scaling up successes for greater impact. This is partly enabled through projects funded by the National Implementing Entity (NIE), which aims to
deliver tangible results through the implementation of projects that address climate change adaptation in vulnerable communities in South Africa and make
the case for further investments in climate change adaptation.

 SO 3. Biodiversity considerations are mainstreamed into policies, strategies and practices of a range of sectors

Biodiversity mainstreaming is the process of embedding biodiversity considerations into policies, strategies and practices of key public and private actors that
impact or rely on biodiversity, so that it is conserved and sustainably used both locally and globally**. Mainstreaming biodiversity is central to the
achievement of South Africa’s landscape approach to managing biodiversity. It relies on partnerships between different sectors across land- and seascapes
and where protected areas sit alongside a matrix of other land- and sea-use types that enhance biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience, whilst
supporting socio-economic development. Mainstreaming seeks to address biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation outside of protected areas, while
strengthening the protection of such areas within land- and seascapes through the promotion of biodiversity-compatible land/sea uses and optimal land/sea
use decisions. South Africa has achieved significant gains through its biodiversity mainstreaming initiatives with the integration of biodiversity into the
national development agenda, including the National Development Plan.

This strategic objective seeks to build on these foundations, ensuring that, through the use of science-based biodiversity tools (Outcome 3.1), biodiversity
considerations are integrated into national, provincial and municipal planning and monitoring, including into the strategies and plans of key production
sectors (Outcome 3.2), and strengthen development authorisations and decision-making (Outcome 3.3). It also seeks to ensure that compliance with
authorisations and permits is monitored and enforced (Outcome 3.4) and that appropriate allocation of resources in key sectors and spheres of government
facilitates effective management of biodiversity, especially in biodiversity priority areas (Outcome 3.5). As an enabling measure, biodiversity considerations
must be integrated into the development and implementation of policy, legislative and other tools (national and multilateral agreements, both those of the
biodiversity sector and beyond it) (Outcome 3.6).

3.1 Effective science-based biodiversity tools inform planning and decision-making

South Africa has developed a number of successful and practical tools that are well used to support planning and decision-making, many of which have been
developed and applied in an integrated and demand-led mainstreaming context in order to meet sector specific needs. These tools include maps of
biodiversity priority areas developed using systematic biodiversity planning and the best available science; guidelines that accompany and add value to maps
of biodiversity priority areas, including guidelines for land/sea use options in biodiversity priority areas as well as guidelines that inform decision-making in
production sectors (e.g. the Mining and Biodiversity Guideline, DEA et al. 2013). Many of these maps and guideline documents are available through online
platforms such as the Biodiversity Advisor, as well as offline (e.g. on CD) in cases where online access is limited. Key to the successful impact of these tools is
that they are developed with the relevant sector, ensuring that the tools are or become embedded in the sector that they target.

4 Huntley, B.J. and K.H. Redford (2014)

39
 The priorities fo

r this NBSAP are to ensure that new tools are developed to support planning and decision-making, and that both new and existing tools are

implemented and maintained. Bioregional plans, which map and identify Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs), and biodiversity management plans for ecosystems
are especially important tools for informing land-use planning, environmental authorisations and natural resource management outside of protected areas.

Bioregional plan

s are powerful tools as they must be used to inform spatial development frameworks (SDFs), integrated development plans (IDPs) and land-

use schemes (LUS) (link to Outcome 3.2).

3.2 Embed biodiversity considerations into national, provincial and municipal development planning and monitoring

The development of science-based biodiversity tools such as bioregional plans or other tools (Outcome 3.1), enables the integration of biodiversity
considerations in development planning and monitoring at national, provincial and municipal levels. The results of a number of successful efforts to date
provide the foundation for priorities in this NBSAP.

In 2012, South Africa’s National Development Plan was published with clear recognition of the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems to the development
path of the country. The subsequent National Infrastructure Plan set out a series of Strategic Integrated Projects (SIPs), which provide the framework for a
massive investment in infrastructure development in South Africa. A clear priority for the NBSAP is to ensure the integration of biodiversity considerations
into the SIPs as well as subsequent national development planning initiatives.

Biodiversity conservation and management can support broader socio-economic goals of rural development and job creation, and has the potential to
contribute to the livelihoods of land reform beneficiaries and communal landowners. Similarly, integrating biodiversity, climate change and IAS considerations
into the planning, practices and monitoring efforts of other sectors, including water, agriculture, coastal management, renewable and non-renewable energy,
land reform and rural development, forestry, fisheries and mining is important in delivering multiple benefits in a sustainable development context.

Opportunities exist particularly in the agriculture, water, land reform sectors, and at a local level in the municipal planning framework, including disaster risk
reduction, for strengthening development through the integration of biodiversity considerations. Already foundations have been laid for integrating
biodiversity considerations into the planning and regulatory frameworks of other sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, mariculture and aquaculture.
For instance, the development and application in the forestry sector of the biodiversity screening tool uses biodiversity planning information to identify sites
that should not be afforested and can thereby be excluded from plantation development plans. This saves time and money in development planning and
applications process. Regional level planning also provides opportunities for collaboration between the private sector and government in addressing shared
risks associated with disaster vulnerability linked to the impacts of climate change, bush fires, flooding and other disasters. At a local level, structures such as
Community Property Associations, Fire Protection Associations and Soil Conservation Committees all present opportunities to strengthen natural resource
management through the integration of biodiversity considerations.

3.3 Strengthen and streamline development authorisations and decision-making

South Africa has made significant progress in mainstreaming biodiversity into environmental authorisations, including Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs). Biodiversity is increasingly routinely incorporated into environmental authorisations through the EIA process, which is governed by the National
Environmental Management Act (NEMA) (Act 107 of 1998) and associated EIA regulations which include lists of biodiversity features that trigger the need for
an environmental authorization.

Priorities include the robust implementation of the full mitigation hierarchy, especially using offsets to deal with residual impacts that are not currently dealt
with. Priorities yet to be effectively addressed include harmonising regulatory requirements across different regulatory processes for land- and sea-use
activities to ensure consistence on biodiversity issues (e.g. setbacks from riparian features), improve compliance and ensure impacts on biodiversity are
effectively assessed and taken into consideration (e.g. ensuring timeframe requirements for EIAs accommodates seasonality and scale required for effective
biodiversity assessments). This is essential to ensure authorisations and decision-making processes are integrated, efficient and promote sustainable
development. This includes identifying areas where certain types of development is prohibited e.g. ‘no-go’ areas for mining. Engaging with sectors prior to the
application for permits or authorisations is also important to ensure consistency and alignment under different regulatory frameworks (links to Outcome 3.6).
Strategic Environmental Assessments provide an important means of achieving this. As the system for environmental management is still evolving
opportunities need to be sought for improved alignment.

3.4 Compliance with authorisations and permits is monitored and enforced

There have been important achievements in environmental compliance and enforcement, including the integration of units dealing with ‘green, blue and
brown’ compliance and enforcement issues into an integrated team. There have also been increases in the number of environmental management
inspectors, the effectiveness of compliance and enforcement activities (e.g. the finalisation of criminal investigation dockets), and in the number of directives
and compliance notices issued. However, in its National Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Report for 2013/14 DEA notes ongoing concern with the
high incidence of illegal activities related to biodiversity and environmental impact assessment requirements.

DEA has recently developed a Compliance and Enforcement Strategy for the Environmental Management Inspectorate (EMI) which aims to ensure that
compliance and enforcement interventions are properly coordinated and effective. The effective implementation, maintenance and monitoring of this
strategy is a major priority for the sector going forward. In its 2019 Strategic Plan, DEA has also prioritized strengthening the work of the EMI, including an
annual increase in the number of inspections conducted each year from 135 in 2014/15, resulting in the inspection of over 750 facilities with environmental
authorisations by 2019. DEA has also prioritized the training of environmental management inspectors with a target of 1060 EMIs receiving training over the
next five years by 2019.

An achievement over the last 10 years has been greater coordination through the Permitting and Enforcement Planning Committee and a Standard Operating
Procedure with South African Police Service around enforcement linked to environmental crime.

 3.5 Appropriate allocation of resources in key sectors and spheres of government facilitates effective management of biodiversity, especially in
biodiversity priority areas

While progress has been made in growing and diversifying sources of finance for biodiversity management, South Africa’s Fifth National Report to the CBD
cites limited financial resources (e.g. for protected area management) as one of the ongoing challenges for the biodiversity sector. Opportunities to mobilise
additional resources for biodiversity management fall into two broad categories: (i) increasing funding available for biodiversity through the fiscus as well as
non-state resources, and (ii) strengthening the framework of economic instruments that support biodiversity management. Examples of economic
instruments and other sustainable finance schemes include: creating incentives that encourage investments by the private sector such as green bonds,
payments for ecosystem services, and tax incentives; and full cost accounting of natural resources such as water.

An important global initiative targeted at addressing this issue is the UNDP’s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) which is managed by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the European Commission and the Governments of Germany and Switzerland. Currently, 29 countries
are participating in BIOFIN, including South Africa, where BIOFIN is being implemented by DEA in collaboration with the National Treasury. BIOFIN aims to
develop a comprehensive national resource mobilizing strategy, improve cost effectiveness through the mainstreaming of biodiversity into national
development and sectoral planning, and develop a methodology for quantifying the biodiversity finance gap at national level. The project will pilot a new
approach and methodology for leveraging increased biodiversity investment at the national level. Implementing the BIOFIN project in South Africa is
important to the implementation of the NBSAP.

Other priorities include integrating biodiversity considerations into national, provincial and municipal budgets through intergovernmental structures,
strengthening economic incentives (including removing perverse incentives) for biodiversity management, and streamlining environment sector functions and
responsibilities at national and provincial level, with appropriate monitoring and enforcement, to ensure equitable allocation of resources for biodiversity
against budgeted priorities.

3.6 Biodiversity considerations are integrated into the development and implementation of policy, legislative and other tools

Mainstreaming biodiversity objectives into the policies, strategies and practices of other sectors has been a major focus of the NBSAP 2005 with clear

priorities, highlighted in the Fifth National Report to the CBD, to take this work forward. Foundations for mainstreaming are laid with the use of integrated

science-based biodiversity tools that inform the development of policies and legislation. South Africa has a well-developed biodiversity policy and legislative
environment that is firmly integrated into the science-policy interface (link to Outcome 6.4). Key achievements are listed in the Fifth National Report to the
CBD and extend across the breadth of the management and protection of species and ecosystems, and include progress in integrating biodiversity

considerations into relevant policies of other sectors, such as the National Water Resource Strategy. These gains are enabling but the implementation,
 maintenance and monitoring of these measures is required to ensure the long term persistence of biodiversity. Review and updating existing legislation,
policy and tools is often necessary. For instance, a priority for the next 10 years is the review of effectiveness of measures, such as BMP-S and recovery plans
for prioritized species (especially marine living resources), and regulations that deal with the management and protection of species (including damage
causing animals) and the activities that impact on species.

Activities prioritized for the current NBSAP include relevant amendments, revisions and updates to the biodiversity sector’s own legislation, including the
revision of the Biodiversity Act, finalization of the revision of the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act, 1983 (Act No. 43 of 1983), the development of a
robust policy framework for biodiversity offsets to ensure that offsets can be efficiently implemented, the development of legislation that would provide for
legal protection of critically endangered species occurring at single sites, updating South Africa’s access and benefit sharing legislation and the approval of the
Biological Invasions Strategy.

Also prioritised is the integration of biodiversity considerations into the policies, legislation, guidelines and codes of conduct of other sectors including land
use planning, agriculture, climate change, waste management, renewable and non-renewable energy, genetically modified organisations, invasive species and
land degradation. At an international level, South Africa has ratified numerous multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) which require ongoing national
implementation and global engagement.

 SO 4. People are mobilised to adopt practices that sustain the long-term benefits of biodiversity.

Biodiversity is not widely understood by the general public and as a result the economic, social and environmental importance of biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure is often poorly recognised. While a better awareness and understanding of the environmental, cultural, economic and intrinsic
values of biodiversity is important in building motivation for action, individuals also need to be aware of the actions they can take to conserve and sustainably
use biodiversity. Different segments of society can take different actions depending on the types of activities they have control and influence over. Strategic
objective 3 addresses mainstreaming biodiversity into production sectors and government, thereby influencing policies, plans and practices. This strategic
objective focuses on mobilising people in the general public to adopt practices that sustain the long term benefits of biodiversity.

People need to be mobilised to adopt practices that enable them to both benefit optimally from biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure and to
address the direct and underlying drivers of biodiversity loss that pose multiple risks to society. This strategic objective therefore seeks to enhance people’s
awareness, understanding and appreciation of the diverse values of biodiversity through more effective coordination and messaging by the biodiversity
sector (Outcome 4.1) and to mobilise people take actions and make choices that support the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity (Outcome 4.2).

4.1 People’s awareness of the value of biodiversity is enhanced through more effective coordination and messaging

The lack of an aligned and coordinated approach to the awareness raising and communications work emanating from the biodiversity sector has resulted in
messaging that is sometimes contradictory and confusing. The link between economic development and biodiversity is not well understood, and biodiversity
is commonly seen as being in competition with socio-economic imperatives. In 2010, the Making the Case for Biodiversity project helped to develop a more
inspiring approach to the messaging and communications of the sector. The Fifth National Report to the CBD cites as a priority the need to bring the
biodiversity sector as a whole along with this shift in messaging. Organisations and individuals in the sector still revert to “doom and gloom” messaging which
tends to elicit apathy rather than action in the target audience. The development and implementation of a properly funded national biodiversity
communications, education and awareness strategy is a critical priority towards addressing this challenge (links to Outcome 6.5). South Africa has a number
of successful citizen science programmes that have gone a long way to both harnessing knowledge and deepening environmental literacy in the public arena.
Strengthening the work of these programmes is a priority. Similarly, solid progress has been made in including relevant biodiversity (including climate change
adaptation education) content into school curricula. Taking this forward requires improving the understanding of educators of this content, as well as
developing and improving methodologies for teaching.

4.2 People are mobilised to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity

Building on enhanced awareness of the value of biodiversity, efforts are needed to move people towards more biodiversity-friendly actions. Much work has
been done to integrate biodiversity into the production of consumer goods and services including fish, red meat, wine and tourism, amongst others. With a
range of biodiversity-friendly options available, consumers need to be aware of these choices in the marketplace and encouraged to make more biodiversity-
friendly choices about where they vacation, what food they eat, wine they drink and companies they support. Tourism in South Africa is underpinned by
biodiversity assets and is one of the fastest growing sectors of the South African and global economy, contributing billions of Rands to the economy and
creating thousands of jobs. Opportunities exist to profile the importance of biodiversity in South Africa’s tourism economy. Biodiversity criteria have been
successfully integrated into the production and marketing of wine and fish; deeper consumer support for these and other products will increase the value and
sustainable use of biodiversity.

 SO 5. Conservation and management of biodiversity is improved through the development of an equitable and suitably skilled workforce.

Harnessing the benefits of South Africa’s biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure requires an equitable and skilled workforce of biodiversity
professionals and technicians to implement the sector’s expanding and increasingly complex mandate. This requires both the strengthening and
transformation of all organisations involved in biodiversity conservation, research and management. Conservation agencies, research institutes, government
departments, private companies and not-for-profits with a biodiversity mandate all need capable and qualified managers, conservators or researchers, and to
help increase the number of black South Africans in leadership positions for these functions”.

Recognizing this challenge, the NBSAP 2005 and the National Biodiversity Framework identified the need for a strategic and comprehensive initiative to
strengthen and diversify the human capital of the biodiversity sector. This resulted in the Human Capital Development Strategy (HCDS) for the Biodiversity
Sector (referred to as the BHCDS), which aims to expand, transform and equip the biodiversity sector workforce with the relevant and quality higher-level
biodiversity skills required to meet the needs of the sector’s mandate. The BHCDS led to the establishment of GreenMatter, a partnership initiative of SANBI
and the Lewis Foundation that drives transformation in graduate level skills for biodiversity.

This strategic objective seeks to build on the work done to date through the BHCDS by ensuring the enabling conditions for the growth and transformation of
the capacity in the sector are in place (Outcome 5.1), the needs of the biodiversity sector are incorporated into skills development and planning (Outcome
5.2), and institutions are capacitated to deliver on their mandates (Outcome 5.3).

5.1 Macro-level conditions enabled for skills planning, development and evaluation of the sector as a whole

The transformation and growth of relevant, high quality skills in the biodiversity sector requires coordination of existing capacity building efforts and
resources, as well the targeted investment of additional resources required for human capital development. Significant progress has been made with the
development and implementation of the BHCDS and the establishment of GreenMatter, a partnership initiative of SANBI and the Lewis Foundation that drives
transformation in graduate level skills for biodiversity with support from a network of other partners. GreenMatter is largely donor-funded, which is not
sustainable and national level coordination is required to help identify and address blockages preventing the effectiveness of HCD initiatives. Priorities for the
NBSAP include the ongoing implementation of the BHCDS, the development of an effective and sustainably funded national level coordinating mechanism for
capacity development, and the development of improved mechanisms to effectively evaluate HCD initiatives.

5.2 An improved skills development system incorporates the needs of the biodiversity sector

One of the key challenges that the BHCDS has identified is the fact that the biodiversity sector does not participate in national planning for skills provisioning.
There is a misalignment between biodiversity needs and higher education systems and between university curricula and emerging biodiversity needs.
Experiential learning and work-integrated learning opportunities currently funded by the state are not supporting biodiversity priorities and people are under-
qualified, lack experiential learning and work integrated learning opportunities and are therefore unable to enter the workplace. Further, the majority of
students studying to enter the sector are not from previously disadvantaged groups resulting in low levels of transformation, and no one is providing
graduates with holistic development and employability skills to enter the workplace — a gap the GreenMatter Fellowship is trying to address. The sector also
lacks a dedicated facility to drive knowledge generation for biodiversity in South Africa. Priorities identified in the GroenSebenza Pioneer youth survey
included the need for entry level job opportunities in the sector for youth, and for youth to be more involved in and empowered to contribute towards
biodiversity management through on the job training. Access to education in rural areas was identified as another priority.

The priorities for the NBSAP are therefore to improve the quality and relevance of skills produced for biodiversity, to increase the number of talented black
South Africans entering the sector and to nurture a high end skills pipeline for biodiversity in South Africa through bursaries, Centres of Excellence focusing on

54
 research excellence on biodiversity issues, and Research Chairs supporting capacity development for biodiversity management.

5.3 Partnerships are developed and institutions are capacitated to deliver on their mandates towards improved service delivery

High vacancy rates plague institutions responsible for biodiversity management in South Africa. The BHCDS cites an average vacancy rate of 22% in public
biodiversity agencies, increasing to 37% among nature conservation professionals, 41% in other nature and oceanographic occupations, and 51% in nature
conservation technicians. 30% of people working in biodiversity agencies, organisations and institutions are not qualified to take on their allocated
responsibilities. There have also been huge fluctuations among managers and professional staff, some of which can be attributed to moving from
organisation to organisation within the biodiversity sector due largely to employment conditions. These conditions highlight a priority for the NBSAP to

59
 improve retention and effective deployment of suitable individuals in the sector. It also highlights a priority to influence and improve the capacity that exists
in the biodiversity sector and other sectors to improve service delivery and support effective biodiversity management. This is about key partners and
government departments having the capacity to implement the legislation and their mandates in terms of NEMA.

Institutional absorption capacity also hinders the opportunity to create jobs by significantly growing labour intensive programmes of work to align with the
needs and opportunities in the natural resource management. This is a nascent opportunity to build on the successes of the existing natural resource
management job creation programmes and contribute towards the imperatives of the green economy. A priority for the NBSAP are therefore to grow the
institutional absorption capacity to implement labour intensive programmes of work in the sector.

Given the multi-jurisdictional/cross-boundary nature of biodiversity, strengthening institutional capacity for effective coordination and cooperation with other
departments, institutions, sectors, and countries is another area of priority for the NBSAP.

 SO6. Effective knowledge foundations, including indigenous knowledge and citizen science, support management, conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity

Strong knowledge foundations underpin effective management, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, which supports delivery of services and
benefits to society. This is therefore an enabling strategic objective that is fundamental to the achievement of all other strategic objectives (see Figure 12).

Effective knowledge foundations are built on foundational datasets on species and ecosystems (Outcome 6.1), regular monitoring and assessments of
biodiversity (Outcome 6.2), the identification of geographic priority areas for the management, conservation and restoration of biodiversity assets and
ecological infrastructure (Outcome 6.3), and research and analysis that is management- and policy-relevant (Outcome 6.4). Finally, it is important that the
knowledge base is accessible and presented in a way that improves the leverage of biodiversity data and informs decision-making (Outcome 6.5).

6.1 Relevant foundational data sets on species and ecosystems are in place and well coordinated

Foundational information on South Africa’s biodiversity underpins effective biodiversity management and conservation required by the NBSAP. It enables
management of biodiversity assets, investment in ecological infrastructure, and mainstreaming of biodiversity into planning, policies and practices of different
spheres of government and sectors, informs effective communication, education, and public awareness, facilitates monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity
targets, and supports research objectives.

South Africa has relatively good foundational datasets on species and ecosystems that have been developed over decades. The development of these
datasets has benefitted significantly from contributions of civil society and non-governmental organisations, for instance citizen science survey projects such
as atlas projects for birds, reptiles, frogs, butterflies, proteas and spiders. Citizen scientists and NGOs will continue to play a crucial role in maintaining and
updating datasets, particularly related to the distribution data on species, which is an extensive and demanding task. National parks can also play important
role in supporting the provision of high resolution data to facilitate refinement of national data layers used in biodiversity assessments. Citizen scientists
contribute in significant ways to collecting biodiversity data. There remain however gaps in foundational data that need to be filled in order to inform
research, policy, management and conservation of ecosystems and species. Examples of priority gaps include, but are not limited to, gaps related to medicinal
plants, undertaking surveys in under-sampled areas, and inventory lists of invasive alien species in World Heritage Sites, protected areas or Ramsar sites.
Capturing and safeguarding indigenous knowledge linked to biodiversity is also an important priority in the future, along with the development and
maintenance of long-term large-scale datasets that can inform research and policy.

6.2 The status of species and ecosystems is regularly monitored and assessed

Regular monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity status and trends is essential to informed decision making in environmental planning and management.
Together with research it is essential to addressing gaps in our knowledge, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and the generation of new
knowledge and information. It is the mandate of the South African National Biodiversity Institute, in terms of the Biodiversity Act to monitor and report
regularly on the state of biodiversity. A national system for monitoring the status and trends of target species and for monitoring ecosystem health is being
designed and it is critical that it be implemented effectively. South Africa already reports on the state of biodiversity, in the National Biodiversity Assessment
(NBA), and this must be revised and updated at least every seven years. The NBA provides the broad framework for reporting on species and ecosystems
monitored and assessed and includes amongst others, key indicators of species and ecosystem status (threatened and protected). Maintenance of an
updated classification of species and ecosystems is an essential foundation for monitoring and assessment of biodiversity, as is the monitoring and mapping
of activities that put pressure on biodiversity, including in marine ecosystems where these are often not directly visible (e.g. impacts on fishing).

Citizen science monitoring projects make an important contribution to monitoring efforts and these initiatives should be supported in order to harness citizen
science collaboration and optimize the contribution they make to national monitoring efforts and biodiversity

6.3 Geographic priority areas for the management, conservation and restoration of biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure are identified based
on best available science

South Africa has well-established track-record and capacity for identifying geographic priority areas through highly developed spatial biodiversity planning
methods and techniques that are at the forefront of international practice. These areas are identified based on best available science and relate directly to
policy and legislative tools in South Africa. The maps and accompanying data of these geographic areas provide fundamental information necessary for
effective planning and decision-making in the biodiversity sector and beyond. Importantly, they help to focus the limited resources available for conserving
and managing biodiversity in areas that will make the most difference, and can inform planning and decision-making in a range of sectors, especially those
that impact directly on biodiversity.

The identification of geographic priority areas for the management, conservation and restoration of biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure based on
best available science remains a priority. This requires necessitates setting appropriate quantitative biodiversity targets for biodiversity features and mapping
ecological and socio-economic features that should inform spatial prioritization (such as important ecological infrastructure, Important Bird and Biodiversity
Areas, or areas that are important to climate change resilience). An important priority for the NBSAP is ensuring that spatial biodiversity plans are regularly
updated as knowledge is strengthened.

6.4 Management-relevant and policy-relevant research and analysis is undertaken through collaboration between scientists and practitioners

Effective management and conservation of biodiversity must be supported by management and policy-relevant research and analysis. This includes the
knowledge, evidence base, tools and models to support planning and management to reduce the loss of biodiversity and maintain ecological infrastructure,

61
 and knowledge about the contribution of biodiversity to sustainable development and human wellbeing. It also provides specific and quantified evidence to
make the case for biodiversity at a policy level, guides decision making, and promotes the mainstreaming of biodiversity in key economic sectors with a high
impact on biodiversity.

A National Biodiversity Research Development and Evidence Strategy (2015-2025) has been developed to guide research and collaboration that supports
research development and evidence generation that addresses emerging needs. This includes: a strong applied focus supporting research that grows
knowledge and the evidence base in key areas; the provision of knowledge to support policies for a sustainable future, such as showing the contribution of
biodiversity assets (such as protected areas) and ecological infrastructure to food security, health, energy, water provision and job creation; and the provision
of a mechanism to assess contested areas of knowledge from different perspectives. Research priorities that emerged through the process of developing the
revised NBSAP include research on/into:

e The effectiveness of efforts to manage, conserve and restore biodiversity assets and ecological infrastructure.

e Quantification of the return on investment and an evidence base to improve our predictive power of what the benefits of specific ecological
infrastructure interventions will be.

e The impact of current and future threatening processes on biodiversity, and mechanisms for adaptation, management and mitigation for example
research to address genetic pollution (e.g. colour variance) linked to requirements of the hunting industry and research on risk assessment s and how
they are conducted.

e Research on how to get science into policy — how policies get developed and where to feed evidence into this.

e Indigenous knowledge related to utilization of biodiversity assets.

e Taxonomic revisions of priority genera produced.

Engagement between scientists and practitioners through new and existing national forums, and in international policy development and decision-making
platforms is important for ensuring collaboration of efforts towards evidence-based policy and decision-making. These platforms help to ensure that there is
an effective feedback loop between outcomes of policies and decisions and knowledge generation. This is critical to support an adaptive management
approach to biodiversity management.

Informed decision-making is enabled by decision or policy makers using effective mechanisms through which to access and interpret the relevant knowledge
base and by the scientific community better understanding the needs of decision makers in order to provide them with the relevant information. This
supports research and analysis that is held to be scientifically credible and sufficiently robust to support effective, appropriate and consistent management,
regulation, conservation and protection of biodiversity and the development and implementation of adequate local, national and international policies. The
extraction and dissemination of key policy and management-relevant information and messages is another priority.

6.5 Knowledge base is accessible and presented in a way that informs decision-making

Proactively harnessing, organising, refining, synthesizing and managing biodiversity information and knowledge such that it is accessible is essential for
supporting policy development and decision-making that integrates biodiversity considerations. Infrastructure or systems that provide for integrated

63
 biodiversity information management are essential to this. A priority for the NBSAP is the development of biodiversity information management systems that
facilitate serving various forms of biodiversity information and tools, integrating this information to allow quick and simple access for decision-making, and
ensuring alignment with other data portals.

The development of tools that use biodiversity data to provide more responsive analyses for science to policy purposes are also important. These may be
tools such as early warning systems and/or predictive scenarios for issues such as climate change, land use impacts, or new and emerging technology (e.g.
synthetic biology). This outcome is fundamental to supporting the implementation of the NBSAP, and contributes to the fulfilment of objectives included in
the Aichi Targets.

 Flagship projects

Flagship projects are existing projects that help to make the case for biodiversity, are
strategically important for biodiversity and development, and demonstrate how the NBSAP
will be implemented.

They are of substantial size in terms of their scientific contribution, number of project
partners, running time or financial volume. They may include projects that pilot innovative
approaches or interventions, promote foundational research that underpins other strategic
objectives of the NBSAP, or help to address major development issues in South Africa.

Flagship projects were identified during the course of the revision of the NBSAP with
stakeholder consultation and guidance from the Project Steering Committee. Figure 14 shows
how these projects broadly relate to the strategic objectives of the NBSAP.

 BIOFIN BIOFIN is a global initiative launched during the 11‘ Conference of the Parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity in October 2012. It seeks to address the biodiversity
finance challenge in a comprehensive manner by defining biodiversity finance needs and
gaps through detailed national-level assessments and determining and leveraging
challenges and opportunities for resource mobilisation. This Initiative is managed by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the European
Commission and the Governments of Germany and Switzerland. Currently, 29 countries
are participating in BIOFIN, including South Africa.

In South Africa, BIOFIN is being implemented by the Department of Environmental
Affairs in collaboration with the National Treasury. BIOFIN aims to develop a
comprehensive national resource mobilizing strategy, improve cost effectiveness
through the mainstreaming of biodiversity into national development and sectoral
planning, and develop a methodology for quantifying the biodiversity finance gap at
national level.

BIOFIN is a funded, existing project that supports the implementation of the NBSAP as a
whole. It is of interest in the international arena and the ultimate success of BIOFIN
means improved resource mobilisation for achieving the Aichi targets and the revised
NBSAP objectives.

Operation Operation Phakisa is an initiative of the South African government designed to fast track
Phakisa the implementation of solutions on critical development issues highlighted in the

National Development Plan (NDP) 2030. Operation Phakisa is a results-driven approach
to translate plans into concrete results through dedicated delivery and collaboration. It
focusses on bringing key stakeholders from the public and private sectors, tertiary and
research institutes as well as civil society organisations together to collaborate in
detailed problem analysis, priority setting, intervention planning, and delivery. The
implementation of the plans are rigorously monitored and reported on, and
implementation challenges are actively managed for effective and efficient resolution.

Operation Phakisa is initially implemented in two sectors, the ocean economy and health
and may grow to include others. The Operation Phakisa in the ocean economy is focused
on implementing priority programmes that will unlock the economic potential of South
Africa’s oceans in a way that helps to address poverty and unemployment. Marine
protection services and ocean governance is one of the four priority areas within this.
Expansion of marine protected areas is an important component of this.

Biodiversity The concept of geographic nodes focusing on a particular type of economic development
economy is taken from the SIPs. Nodes focused on the biodiversity economy have potential for the
transformation development of a prosperous and sustainable biodiversity economy that supports social
nodes and economic development, biodiversity economy transformation, poverty alleviation,

and job creation.

The development potential of our rich biodiversity and heritage assets in these nodes is
harnessed using the strengths of the various partners to create a vibrant biodiversity
economy. These nodes therefore support the implementation of the NBSAP where the
management of biodiversity assets (including conservation) and investment in ecological
infrastructure contribute to the economy, job creation, rural development, enhanced
resilience and benefits to society.

An existing biodiversity economy node, the Umfolozi Biodiversity Economy Node is
comprised of a series of protected areas around the southern reaches of Ulundi, and
includes Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, three communal areas being declared as protected
areas, and other communally, privately and state owned land. The area has the potential
to create a conservation area in excess of 150 000 hectares with a mosaic of sustainable
land uses in the dry-land ecosystem where very few other viable land use options to
grow the rural economy exist. The development of the Umfolozi Biodiversity Economy
Node is facilitated by the wildlife industry through the South African Hunters and Game

Conservation Association (SAHGCA). Existing productive partnerships are strengthened
and new ones between government, communities and private sector established,
harnessing the strengths of the various sectors. Although in its infancy, it is already
demonstrating that it is possible to achieve sustained economic growth together with
securing the natural and heritage resources in an integrated land use planning
framework.

Biodiversity economy transformation (BET) nodes are a focus of the National Biodiversity
Economy Strategy (NBES). The priority nodes form part of an enabling environment for
communities and entrepreneurs to participate in the biodiversity economy, while
contributing to poverty alleviation, sustainable development and conservation of the
country’s biodiversity and ecosystem services. These nodes are informed by, amongst
other criteria, the Presidential Poverty Nodes for government action, the areas
prioritised by the DRDLR, and local economic development (LED) imperatives of local and
provincial government. Implementation of the BET node concept in any and all of the
priority nodes is a flagship project for the NBSAP.

The eThekwini Water and Sanitation Unit’s ability to deliver the volume and quality of
fresh water required within Durban and to provide sanitation services is becoming
increasingly compromised by catchment conditions and dynamics external to the
Municipal boundary, specifically in the uMngeni, upper Mooi and Mkomazi catchments.
The contribution that ecological infrastructure makes to enhancing water security in the
uMngeni is significant and to this end a partnership to safeguard, rehabilitate and
manage the ecological infrastructure within the uMngeni catchment has been
established. Partners include eThekwini Municipality's Environmental Planning and
Climate Protection Department, the KZN office of the Department of Water Affairs,
uMngeni Water, SANBI and a host of other stakeholder organisations. The project
includes three pilot projects for the programme each found within a participating
municipality. A Memorandum of Understanding for the uMngeni Ecological
Infrastructure Partnership (UEIP) was signed in November 2013. The uMngeni, including
the upper Mooi River catchment above the Spring Grove Dam and Mearn’s Weir, and
the Upper Mkomazi River catchment above the planned Smithfield and Impendle Dams,
in addition to the catchment of uMngeni River itself, is the focus of a possible 19"
Strategic Integrated Project (SIP) being considered by the Presidential Infrastructure
Coordinating Committee (PICC).

The Umzimvubu Catchment Partnership Programme (UCPP) aims to conserve the full
extent of the Umzimvubu River system (from source to sea) through the sustainable
restoration and maintenance of the catchment area in a manner that supports economic
development and job creation for local people and enhances flow of benefits from
ecosystem goods and services to people and nature.

The Umzimvubu River System is prioritized nationally as one of the few remaining “near-
atural rivers” but is classified as vulnerable as a result of rapid rates of degradation in
he watershed. In addition to the freshwater system, the adjacent matrix of grassland,
orest, thicket, and dune vegetation are some of the most biodiverse in the world.

as

he UCPP adopts an action-learning and systems approach, aimed at restoring and
rotecting catchment integrity and stability, improving livelihoods and resilience of
cosystems and economies, through robust multi stakeholder institutional co-operation.
he UCPP has over 30 partners that include but is not limited to local communities, local
government authorities, provincial and national government, other public entities,
cientists, the academic community, the private sector, community-based organizations
and NGOs.

other regulatory authorities that regulate land use decisions to incorporate criteria to
avoid/ prevent, minimize and/or offset impacts on biodiversity, and improve compliance
monitoring and enforcement. It aims to introduce mechanisms in collaboration with
private and communal land owners to better protect critical biodiversity areas and
manage land, while demonstrating the potential of biodiversity to create jobs and
contribute to economic growth. The project will work in four district municipalities in
global biodiversity hotspots and national biodiversity priority areas, with high rates of
habitat degradation and conversion, high levels of poverty, and other pressing needs for
action. These include the Amathole, uMgungundlovu, Ehlanzeni, and the Cape
Winelands District Municipalities.

The Kids in Parks Programme provides a unique opportunity for learners and their
educators to visit a national park and learn about natural and cultural heritage. Run as a
three-day programme, it exposes learners from nearby schools — and mostly from
disadvantaged backgrounds — to the wonders of South Africa’s natural heritage in
National Parks. Children learn about biodiversity and why it is important, fun and worth
conserving through range of fun activities and educational material. The Kids in Parks
initiative is being phased in over a period of three years. Each year five different parks
will welcome ten groups of 50 learners and 2 teachers. This means that eventually a total
of 7 500 learners, 300 educators from 150 primary schools will have visited 15 parks. The
programme is a partnership between SANParks, Pick ‘n Pay and the departments of
Environmental Affairs (DEA) and Education (DoE).

 

Fundisa for Change is a collaborative programme formed specifically to enhance
transformative environmental learning through teacher education. It was established as
a partnership programme involving many of South Africa's major environmental
organisations, including state, parastatal, NGO and private companies, which have an
interest in teacher education. Fundisa’s core objective is to strengthen the teaching of
environmental concepts in schools. Established in 2011 the network was established in
response to research findings from three major environmental sector strategy research
programmes: the South African Environmental Sector Skills Plan, the SANBI GreenMatter
project and the Biodiversity Human Capital Development Strategy; and the Global
Change Grand Challenge National Research Plan Human Capital Development Strategy.
These highlighted that the foundations of environmental learning in South Africa needed
more attention if the environmental sector human capital development needs of the
country were to be met within a longer term sustainability paradigm.

GreenMatter is a partnership initiative of SANBI and the Lewis Foundation established to
grow biodiversity skills - developing the right people at the right time for the green
economy. There are various strategies and frameworks in place to address the demand
for more relevant and quality environmental skills in South Africa such as Environmental
Sector Skills Plan (ESSP) and the Department of Science and Technologies Global Change
Human Capital Development Strategy. However, a concerted national effort is required
to drive biodiversity skills development, and that is the specific need to which the
GreenMatter Project network of partners responds to through the Biodiversity Human
Capital Development Strategy (BHCDS). This flagship project directly supports the
implementation of the NBSAP Strategic Objective 5, and contributes to the
implementation of the NBSAP as a whole.

Foundational biodiversity information underpins the implementation of the NBSAP. The
Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP) aims to fund the generation,
mobilization and integration of priority foundational biodiversity knowledge and
information so that this can be managed, secured and disseminated to address the
needs of society, the Department of Science & Technology (DST) Global Change
Programme and the bio-economy.

FBIP is an integrated programme that covers programmes such as the South African
Biodiversity Information Facility (SABIF), the South African Biosystematics Initiative (SABI)
and SeaKeys. SeaKeys is the first large collaborative project funded through the FBIP and

Region

aims to deliver: national species lists, new species distribution records, DNA barcodes
(for common, invasive, commercially important, rare and threatened species), new
species descriptions, identification guides and maps, and new tools for ocean decision-
making.

The Programme will deliver products that contribute to the fulfilment of objectives
included in the Aichi Targets, the Global Taxonomic Initiative of the CBD, the Biodiversity
Act, NBSAP, NBF, the Global Change and Bio-economy Grand Challenges of DST and its
programme on Indigenous Knowledge Systems.

An integrated National Biodiversity Information System is core to proactively harnessing,
organising, refining, synthesizing and managing biodiversity information and knowledge
such that it is accessible and supports policy development and decision-making. It will
allow quick and simple access to the biodiversity information and knowledge resource
base and will support greater synergy between and impact of various global and national
initiatives, such as the Encyclopaedia of Life, Global Biodiversity Information Facility and
Biodiversity Heritage Library.

SANBI is leading the development and implementation of the System, performing this
function in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders including government, other
public entities, research institutions, and NGOs. In partnership with others, SANBI will
also develop tools that allow for quick and simple access to the knowledge resource
base, especially to support, research, policy development and decision-making. The NBIS
is fundamental to supporting the implementation of the NBSAP, and contributes to the
fulfilment of objectives included in the Aichi Targets.

 

 

The Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
(IPBES) Secretariat for South Africa is to host an IPBES Technical Support Unit (TSU) for
the Africa Region. The TSU is hosted by the CSIR and receives financial support from
IPBES budget, DEA, and CSIR. The TSU support the IPBES Secretariat in the
implementation of the IPBES work programme in Africa. This includes:

e Providing a mechanism to synthesize, review, assess and critically evaluate relevant
information and knowledge generated by government, tertiary and research
institutes, scientific organizations, non-governmental organizations and indigenous
communities;

e Conducting assessments of such information and knowledge in a transparent way
by credible groups of experts; and

e Strengthening capacity for the effective use of science in decision-making at all
levels.

This work has begun to show how important biodiversity and ecosystems are in
supporting social development, service delivery and economic prosperity, and preparing
for climate change. It thus forms an essential component of long term sustainability,
security and equity for the country and region.

Institutional Coordination and Monitoring

69
 coordinate the implementation of the NBSAP in terms of their roles and responsibilities in this
regard. It also outlines mechanisms for mainstreaming the NBSAP priorities and activities into
the policy frameworks, plans and budgets of other sectors.

The Department of Environmental Affairs is mandated to protect the environment and
conserve natural resources while balancing this with sustainable development and the
equitable distribution of natural resource benefits. DEA fulfils its mandate through
formulating, coordinating and monitoring the implementation of national environmental
policies, programmes and legislation, and through undertaking appropriate research. DEA led
the process in the preparation of the revised NBSAP and is responsible for the coordination
and monitoring of its implementation. A number of structures exist in support of this function
and are outlined below.

Structures for coordination between the spheres of government on environmental issues:

e Minister and Members of Executive Councils (MEC) Committees (MINMEC), which
promotes co-operative governance between the national minister and his or her
respective counterparts at provincial level.

e = Ministerial Technical Committees (MINTECH), which facilitates coordination between
DEA and the provincial environmental departments.

e Aseries of MINTECH Working Groups (WG), which bring together senior officials in
national and provincial government to deal with various environmental management
issues.

The requirements for coordination and reporting on progress under Outcome 10 of the
Presidential Delivery Agreement have resulted in participation of other departments in these
Working Group structures. As a result, these structures provide a valuable forum for
coordination and reporting on the implementation of the NBSAP.

In addition, a number of structures exist for coordination on activities related to multilateral
environmental agreements. These include the Scientific Committee on the Convention on
Migratory Species and the National Ramsar Committee.

Structures provided for to assist with the mainstreaming of NBSAP priorities and activities
into the policy frameworks, plans and budgets of other sectors:

e — Interdepartmental Committee on Inland Water Ecosystems, which brings together all
organs of state relevant to the management of freshwater ecosystems.

¢ — Interdepartmental Project Implementation Committee (IPIC), which was established
with representation of DEA, DWA and the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR),
with the aim of ensuring aligned implementation of the three Acts from which these
departments draw their mandates.

e Regional Mining Development and Environmental Committees (RMDEC), established in
all regions, advise the Minister on objections received to prospecting and mining
rights or permits, and considers objections to environmental management
programmes or plans.

e Other cross-sector collaborations between various institutions catalysed as a result of
the Presidential Delivery Agreement

Structures provided for to enable institutional coordination with stakeholders:

e [UCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) South African National
Committee: IUCN enables its members, comprising governments and NGOs to work
together to address environmental issues at different levels. The South African

70
 National Committee™, which includes

DEA, several other government members and a

number of NGO members, meets regularly to address programmatic issues.

In addition, to these existing fora, DEA will convene an annual meeting of key stakeholders
involved in the implementation of the NBSAP. This will serve as an important platform for
institutional coordination with a particular focus on reviewing and reporting progress towards

the NBSAP objectives.

Clearing House Mechanism

The 10" Conference of the Parties to the CBD*® emphasized the importance of a national

Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) as means to

promote scientific and technical cooperation

among parties to the Convention, and to provide information services to facilitate the
implementation of the NBSAP. The CHM also serves as an important communication and

outreach mechanism for the NBSAP. The CHM

exchange
e

will be coordinated by DEA with the aim of:

Facilitating the creation of a biodiversity knowledge network
Promoting scientific and technical cooperation, knowledge sharing and information

Facilitating the implementation of NBSAP.

The CHM will consist of the DEA website (www.environment.gov.za) as a central node for
information about the NBSAP, with links to relevant information, programmes, work and

partners. Links will be made with the websites

and platforms serving biodiversity information

maintained by SANBI (www.sanbi.org) as these form an important component of the CHM.

Resource Mobilisation Plan

It is recommended that NBSAPs include a reso

urce mobilization plan which sets out the

financial resources needed to implement the NBSAP, how these resources will be mobilised

and from which sources, including the nationa

budget, external assistance and innovative or

alternative financial mechanisms. The resource mobilization plan should include clear,

realistic costing associated with each strategic
assumptions, unit costs and cost ranges.

The BIOFIN Initiative is global programme worl
comprehensive national resource mobilizing s

objective within the NBSAP, including

ing in pilot countries to develop a
rategy, improve cost effectiveness through the

mainstreaming of biodiversity into national development and sectoral planning, and develop
a methodology for quantifying the biodiversity finance gap at national level.

As one of the 29 pilot countries, BIOFIN is imp

emented in South Africa by DEA in

collaboration with the UNDP Country Office and National Treasury. The implementation of
BIOFIN in South Africa will involve costing the revised NBSAP and a policy and institutional
review to inform an expenditure review on biodiversity. The costing of the NBSAP, and the

expenditure review, will allow for a funding ga

relevant public and private sectors, identified

p analyses. The expenditure review will

hrough the policy and institutional review.

Based on these findings, a resource mobilisation strategy for biodiversity will be developed.

The NBSAP has been aligned with the BIOFIN project to the extent that detail for activities has

 being developed to a level that provides a useful input to the BIOFIN initiative for costing.

More information on BIOFIN is available at http://www. biodiversityfinance.net.

Monitoring and Evaluation

DEA is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the NBSAP, including
provisions for reporting and tracking progress towards the achievement of the targets. Within
DEA, the Chief Directorate: Biodiversity Specialist Monitoring and Services coordinates and
oversees monitoring and reporting.

Key components of the Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting of the NBSAP include:

e Alignment with national reporting frameworks: Efforts have been made to ensure the
revised NBSAP is integrated and aligned with key national strategic plans. This
ensures that departments and organisations are working towards and reporting on a
common set of indicators and targets. Of particular relevance are the MTSF and
Outcome 10. The strategic plans and annual performance of each national and
provincial department are aligned with the MTSF and the Outcome agreements,
which departments report on throughout the year. By aligning the NBSAP with these
plans and their monitoring and reporting frameworks, it reduces the burden of
reporting and ensures alignment between South Africa’s national and international
commitments.

e National Reports to the CBD’*: National Reports to the CBD are required for reporting
on progress towards measures taken for the implementation of the Convention,
which are reflected in the NBSAP. The fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties
agreed that national reports would be called for on a four-yearly basis. National
Reports are important tools in the monitoring and reporting of NBSAPs and also form
useful tools to assist with implementation.

e The National Biodiversity Framework: The NBF, provided for as a legislated tool in
terms of the Biodiversity Act, identifies the top priority actions and targets for
biodiversity management and conservation over a five-year period. Together, the
NBF and the NBSAP form the medium term and long range strategic plans for
biodiversity management.

A note on indicators and targets:

As far as possible, the NBSAP has drawn on existing indicators and targets, such as those in
the MTSF, Outcome 10 or departmental long range strategic plans. This has been done to
ensure that the NBSAP is integrated and aligned with and is contributing towards the
achievement of existing priorities. Implementing and reporting on the NBSAP is therefore part
of government’s programme of delivery.

There are however instances where indicators and targets do not exist for certain areas of
work. These have been identified in the action plan. In some cases indicators have been
proposed, however the adoption of and development of targets for these indicators will need
to be taken forward by DEA in its coordination and monitoring role for the NBSAP. This will
also require an exercise to review and align these indicators with the existing set of
indicators.

 South Africa is signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and is committed to the
implementation of a national strategy to conserve plants that aligns with the Global Strategy for
Plant Conservation (GSPC). South Africa has developed a National Strategy for Plant
Conservation (NSPC) with modified global targets. The NBSAP alignment to the NSPC is
presented in Table 5. Alignment is between NBSAP Outcomes and the Outcomes of the NSPC
that sit under its 16 targets, which are grouped under five objectives::

Objective |: Plant diversity is well understood, documented and recognised
Target 1: An online Flora of all known plants
Target 2: An up-to-date assessment of the conservation status of all South African
species
Target 3: Information, research and associated outputs, and methods necessary to
implement the strategy developed and shared
Objective II: Plant diversity is urgently and effectively conserved
Target 4: Biodiversity targets for terrestrial eco-systems secured through effective
management
Target 5: Important areas for plant diversity identified and incorporated into
conservation processes
Target 6: Initiatives in place to ensure the sustainable management of production lands
consistent with the conservation of plant diversity
Target 7: At least 75% of known threatened plant species conserved in situ
Target 8: At least 60% of threatened plants in ex situ collections, preferably in the
country of origin, and available for recovery (restoration) programmes, with 1% in
active reintroduction programmes
Target 9: The genetic diversity of crops, including their wild relatives and indigenous
edible plant species, conserved while respecting, preserving and maintaining
associated indigenous and local knowledge
Target 10: Effective management plans in place to prevent new biological invasions and
to manage important areas for plant diversity that are invaded
Objective III: Plant diversity is used in a sustainable and equitable manner
Target 11: No species of wild flora endangered by international trade
Target 12: All wild harvested plant-based products sourced sustainably
Target 13: Indigenous and local knowledge innovations and practices associated with
plant resources maintained or increased as appropriate to support customary use,
sustainable livelihoods, local food security and healthcare
Objective IV: Education and awareness about plant diversity, its role in sustainable livelihoods
and importance to all life on earth is promoted
Target 14: The importance of plant diversity and the need for its conservation
incorporated into communication, education and public awareness programmes
Objective V: The capacities and public engagement necessary to implement the Strategy have
been developed
Target 15: The number of trained people working with appropriate facilities sufficient
according to national needs, to achieve the targets of this Strategy
Target 16: Institutions, networks and partnerships for plant conservation established or
strengthened at national, regional and international levels to achieve the targets of this
Strategy

Stakeholder consultation

Stakeholder consultation took place during the course of the NBSAP revision through
interviews and stakeholder engagement during two national workshops (November 2014 and
April 2015). Table 6 lists stakeholders engaged with in this manner. Views of the youth were
also sought through a survey targeting the GroenSebenza Pioneers. The survey elicited 28
respondents whose inputs informed the revision of the NBSAP alongside the inputs from

other stakeholders.
