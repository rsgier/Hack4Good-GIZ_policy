 GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Apartheid

A political system and its laws and policies directed towards the
separation of different ethnic or racial groups. Spatially, apartheid
involved the physical separation of the four racial groups according to the
Population Registration Act of 1950 into so-called “Group Areas”
according to the Group Areas Act of 1950. A system of ethnically-based
“Bantustans” for Black South Africans was also established.

Bantustan

Areas reserved for African occupation under the Apartheid government.
Approximately 13% of the total area of South Africa was divided into ten
such Bantustans and were given some degree of self-rule, but always
subject to the wishes and needs of the Apartheid government. While these
areas were incorporated back into South Africa at the dawn of
democracy in 1994, they still suffer the consequences of long-term
neglect, isolation and poverty.

Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas

Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Ecological Support Areas (ESAs), are
natural areas of critical importance for ecological sustainability, and
should be kept in their natural, or at least semi-natural, state. Critical
Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) are divided into two sub-categories: CBA] and
CBA2. CBAI1s are irreplaceable, which means that there are no other
places in the landscape where the conservation and ecological
objectives associated with those CBAs can be met. In CBA2s, there may
be some options for meeting the conservation and ecological objectives
associated with those CBAs in other parts of the landscape. However, this
can only be done at the cost of losing some of the spatial efficiency of
the network of CBAs. If a CBA2 is lost and an alternative natural area

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

elsewhere is identified to become part of the CBA network, the alternative
area is likely to be larger, increasing the size of the CBA-network as a
whole. Areas identified as ESAs should be kept in at least semi-natural
condition, i.e. with their basic ecological functioning still intact.

City

A human settlement characterised by (1) large and generally diverse
communities of people living at high residential densities, (2) a variety of
employment opportunities, and (3) high-intensity business and
commercial areas.

Concentration

Concentration of people and activities refers to (1) a higher density of
people, and (2) a higher intensity and mix of activities in a specific place,
area or region. Generally, such concentration supports the development
and sustenance of agglomeration economies. This can take the form of
urbanisation economies (where cost decreases as total output of an
urban area increases) or localisation economies (where costs decrease
as firms in a specific industry increase output).

Decentralisation

The flow of people and economic activities from an urban centre or node
to outlying (suburban and/or peri-urban) areas or nodes.

Densification

The process of increasing the number of people living in a specific area to
ensure that (1) better use is made of movement infrastructure, services,
ICT networks and amenities by a greater number of people, and (2) the
need for expansion of existing grids, networks and services is reduced.
 Development Corridor

Integrated linear networks of infrastructure and economic activity.
Development corridors typically fulfil a variety of multiple, complex
functions, such as (1) the movement of people and freight, (2) facilitating
trade between areas, (3) flows of information, (4) flows of services such as
water and gas, and (5) facilitating tourism. Supportive functions may be
located in corridors, e.g. logistics. Development corridors often also
include a human settlement and/or economic activity component, e.g.
higher-density  transit-oriented mixed-use development or industrial
development adjacent to, or along the main transport routes.

Diversification

The process of introducing and/or allowing a greater mix of land uses in
an area, to (1) boost local people-to-people service economies, stimulate
co-production of knowledge innovation and create jobs, (2) reduce the
need for travel and travel distances, (3) bring more vibrancy and life to an
area; (4) enhance social interaction and cohesion, and (5) make better
use of available land.

Ecological Footprint

A measure of the ‘load’ imposed by a given population on natural
systems. The bigger the footprint, the greater the impact.

Ecological Infrastructure

Ecological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that
generate or deliver valuable services to people, e.g. water catchments,
wetlands, riparian zones, coastal dunes, kelp beds or spawning grounds.
Ecological infrastructure consists of a network of interconnected structural
elements in the landscape and seascape.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Economic Sectors

A description of the kind of economic activities in a country, or the
activities in which the population of a country are active/working. The
following five categories/sectors of economic activity are generally used
in this regard: (1) the primary sector, which includes agriculture, mining
and other natural resource-based industries; (2) the secondary sector,
which entails manufacturing, engineering and construction; (3) the
tertiary sector, meaning the service industries; (4) the quaternary sector,
which refers to intellectual activities involving education and research;
and (5) the quinary sector, which is reserved for the economic activities of
high-level decision makers in government and industry. In some instances,
including this NSDF, the last two sectors are included in the definition of
the tertiary sector.

Ecosystem

The dynamic and complex interplay of animal, plant, and micro-organism
communities and their non-living environment (soil, water, climate and
atmosphere) as a functional unit.

Ecosystem Services

The beneficial services that nature provide to people. Ecosystem services
are typically grouped into four broad categories: (1) provisioning,
including the production of food and water; (2) regulating, including the
control of climate and disease; (3) supporting, including nutrient cycles
and oxygen production; and (4) cultural, including spiritual and
recreational benefits.

Evidence Mapping

A structured process of seeking, ordering and making sense of relevant
published and unpublished research (i.e. ‘evidence’) to inform the
preparation and review of policy and legislation.
 Food Security

A condition of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable
and nutritious food, through locally-grown produce and/or imports.

Hinterland

The sparsely populated areas close to an urban settlement or node in
which people farm or depend on natural resources for their livelinood,
including the villages and small towns that are dispersed throughout these
areas.

Human Settlement

A place where people live, work, study and relax. A settlement can range
in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to a large city
or groups/conglomerations of cities tied together through dense transport
and communication networks.

Infrastructure

The basic equipment, utilities, productive enterprises, installations, and
services essential for the development, operation, and growth of human
settlements and economic activities. Infrastructure includes items such as
roads, utility lines for water, sanitation and electricity, drainage structures
and communication technology. A distinction is often made between (1)
engineering infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, sewerage, water,
and (2) social infrastructure, which can broadly be defined as the
construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services,
such as health, education, community, welfare support, citizen
registration and cultural facilities.

Land-Use Pattern

The land-use pattern is a general description of how land is occupied or
used, and how land-uses tend to be distributed across a specific

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

geographic area. In the context of the NSDF, the national land-use
pattern is a high-level description of how the (1) population, (2)
settlements, (3) economic activities, and (4) natural areas are distributed
and systemically-related within the country as a whole.

Land Reform

The process of correcting the historical imbalances in (1) ownership of
land, and (2) access to land. It entails three types of intervention by the
State, viz. (1) land restitution, meaning the redress of wrongs committed
during the colonial and Apartheid eras; (2) land redistribution, meaning
the provision of land for residential and economic purposes to those who
do not have the means to access land); and (3) fenure reform, meaning
the provision of security of tenure.

National Development Paradigm

The overarching set of ideas and beliefs and its associated legal and
policy framework, setting out how (1) a country should be developed, (2)
its economic relations should be structured, (3) the benefits of its
economic system should be shared, and (4) its natural resources should
be used and managed.

National Social and Economic Interactions

The dense network of social and economic activities that take place in a
country.

National Spatial Development Framework

A long-term national spatial planning instrument with a long-term horizon
that (1) is mandated by the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management
Act, 2013 (SPLUMA), (2) has to be aligned with the National Development
Plan (NDP), and (3) is adopted by Cabinet as official national spatial
development policy for implementation throughout the country. As such,
 it provides (1) an overarching spatial development framework including a
set of principle-driven spatial investment and development directives for
all three spheres and sectors of government, meaning ‘where, when,
what type, and how much to invest and spend throughout the country’;
and (2) a set of strategic spatial areas of national importance from an
ecological, social, economic and/or ICT or movement infrastructure
perspective, to be targeted by both government and the private sector
in the pursuit of strategic national development objectives, or to avert
national crises.

National Spatial Development Logic

The approach to, and the way in which national space is used and
managed in pursuit of the objectives of the prevailing national
development paradigm.

National Spatial Development Pattern

The outcomes of the national spatial development logic of a country in
national space. As such, it entails (1) where, how and for whom
settlements are built, (2) the land tenure types and land-use patterns in
these settlements, and (3) the type, mix, density, intensity and distribution
of land-uses in these settlements.

Natural Resource Foundation

The natural resources of a country, consisting of both ecosystem services
and sensitive and important ecological systems. These resources need to
be defined, mapped and protected, preferably by law, and their
Utilisation carefully managed for the benefit of the ecological system and
the sustenance of future generations.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Node

Nodes are concentrations and clusters of activities of varying intensity and
density, and can be either mixed-use or mono-functional (e.g. an office
node).

Polycentric system

A functionally integrated system of settlements/nodes of varying size that
co-exist and collaborate in mutually beneficial ways, and in doing so,
enhance the resilience of the system and its constituent parts. The system
allows the provision of a series of social and other services by (1) using the
unique qualities of the various settlements/nodes in the system, and (2)
harnessing the connections between them.

Protected Area

An area of special natural, ecological, architectural or historic interest that
is protected by law. The protected areas referred to in this NSDF are those
areas that are officially classified as such in terms of the National
Environmental Management Act, 1998.

Rural

Generally regarded as areas outside cities and towns. Economic activity
in these areas is in most cases intrinsically tied to natural resource use
and/or beneficiation, and consists of agriculture, fishing, forestry, nature
conservation, eco-tourism and mining. In South Africa, there are rural
areas that are densely populated, but without (1) the distinct and diverse
nodal areas of dense economic activity in the secondary and the tertiary
sectors, or (2) the amenities typically associated with urban areas. These
areas are a remnant of colonial and Apartheid spatial planning and the
creation of Bantustans.
 Rural Development

The process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of
people living in a rural area, by planned interventions in the area in (1) the
ownership and use of land, (2) the provision, maintenance and upgrading
of infrastructure and social services, and (3) the type and intensity of
economic activities.

Rural Edge

A line that is used to delineate a systemically-integrated area/region that
has distinct rural qualities that need to be protected from ‘intruding’ uses
hat may disrupt or destroy these qualities. Typically, the delineation would
be accompanied by (1) a description of the kinds of activities that are
permitted within the area/region, and (2) the procedures to apply for uses
hat are not specified as such. The line may have coordinates and be
statutory, meaning it has binding legal power, or be seen as a soft or ‘fuzzy
ine’, meaning its exact coordinates are not defined, and it is to be used
in a planning and policy sense and not as hard, impenetrable physical
ine.

Ruralisation

he process by which (1) people choose to remain in rural areas because
here are viable economic opportunities, move back to towns and
villages in rural areas from urban areas, and/or build/renovate houses in
hese areas as ‘homes’ for their current needs, or with a view to retirement,
and (2) the State plans for the development of rural areas in a systemic
and holistic way as economically viable, ecologically-significant,
productive quality living spaces, as opposed to colonial and Apartheid
imes in which the little investment that was made in these areas was
ocused on advancing white economic interests in urban areas, and/or
he lives and life chances of white people living in rural towns.

 

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Settlement (also known as ‘Human Settlement’)

A settlement refers to a place where people live, work, study and relax. A
settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped
together, to a large city or groups/conglomerations of cities tied together
through dense transport and communication networks.

Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)

A recently introduced government instrument that seeks to enhance the
process of formulating policies, Acts and regulations by ensuring (1)
alignment of such interventions with national priorities, (2) mitigation of
risks, (3) anticipation of unintended consequences, and (4) minimisation
of costs and maximisation of benefits.

Space Economy

The spatial drivers and spatial manifestations and outcomes of the
economic interactions and transactions that (1) are generated in
‘earth/terra-based space’, (2) take place in that space, and/or (3) flow
through that space. The size, nature, scale and scope of the space
economy of a place/area is related to (1) its unique locational, spatial,
ecological, economic, social, institutional, infrastructural, mineral, soils and
topographical attributes, culture, and history, and (2) its level of
connectedness to, and relations with other places/areas, and the unique
attributes and space economies of those places it is connected to, or
transacts with.

Spatial Planning

The process of making strategic decisions as to (1) how and for what
purpose public, communal and private-owned land in an area (it could
be a street, town, province, country or continent) is to be used and
developed in an environmentally sustainable, economically viable and
affordable way, and (2) how these land portions are to be connected to
 each other through road and rail networks and served with basic service
infrastructure (water, electricity and sanitation) and communication
networks (cellular, wi-fi and fibre).

Spatial Transformation

The  carefully-planned and well-managed process of placing
infrastructure, social services and economic activities in settlements in
such a way that (1) the segregated spatial patterns inherited from colonial
and Apartheid times are broken down, and (2) the inefficiencies, injustices
and inequalities in access to opportunities resulting from these past
patterns are corrected.

Strategic Water Source Areas

Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) can be described as ‘water
factories’ that support growth and development needs that are often a
long distance away from the SWSAs themselves. These areas contribute
significantly to the overall surface and ground water supply of the country.
While Strategic Water Source Areas have been identified by the Water
Research Commission (2015), they are not formally protected.

Stressed Catchments

‘Water stress’ occurs when the amount of water used exceeds 10% of
renewable resources. Water stress depends on a range of factors and is
not simply a shortfall in water availability versus requirement. Water deficits
will not be experienced the same over an entire Water Management
Area, nor at all times. In some cases, the deficits do not imply that
consumptive use exceeds the available water, but that the allowances
made for the implementation of the ecological component of the reserve
cannot be met fully at present levels of use. Stressed catchments are also
impacted upon by ‘water demand/requirement’, which refers specifically

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

to the ‘beneficial, effective and efficient use of water’, which can be
improved through, for example, a reduction in water losses.

Supra-National

Refers to (1) ‘regions’, organisations and structures that are created
‘above the nation state’ by two or more countries, e.g. the African Union
and the Southern African Development Community, to attend to matters
of mutual concern and/or that lie outside the control/reach of a single
country, and (2) agreements, protocols, policies, plans and investment
frameworks prepared for these bigger supra-national entities.

Sustainable Development

Development that meets the needs of the present generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
The definition of sustainable development usually refers to social,
economic and institutional components.

Theory of Change

A story of how things, settings or situations can and will be changed
through a well-planned and sequenced set of actions and interventions,
to bring about a desired goal, situation or state of affairs.

Town

A place where people and services are geographically concentrated in
a distinct and identifiable area. While towns can vary in size, they tend to
have a smaller population, lower residential densities, fewer employment
opportunities and fewer and/or smaller economic activities than cities.

Township

This term has two meanings in the South African context. Firstly, it is a
colloquial name given to residential townships which were established

20
 during the colonial and Apartheid eras for temporary occupation by Black
South Africans on the outskirts of towns and cities, and where only the most
basic of amenities and infrastructure were provided. During colonial times,
these townships were called “locations”, and sometimes still are, albeit
increasingly less so. Secondly, it is the legal name given to new human
settlements and extensions to existing settlements in planning legislation,
e.g. “Sunnyside Extension 3”, dating back to the first Town Planning
Ordinances passed in the early 1900s, and also appearing in the more
recent Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (2013) (SPLUMA).

Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)

A planned intervention that promotes higher density and mixed-use land
development close to significant transit routes. TODs aim to (1) make the
best use of land located along such routes, (2) increase ridership/use of
public transport on the routes, and (3) promote sustainable urban
development.

Urban

A term that refers to a city, being in a city, or ‘of a city’. Urban areas are
characterised by (1) large communities living at high residential densities,
(2) a variety of employment opportunities, and (3) high-intensity business
and commercial areas. The ‘urban-rural distinction’ between cities and
towns varies from country to country, and is most often based on a
combination of factors related to population size, level of economic
output and development density. Generally, large towns are considered
as ‘urban’, whereas small towns are most often regarded as ‘rural’. ‘Urban
regions’ in the context of the NSDF refer to large and growing, functionally
integrated, built-up regions, that are characterised by areas of high
residential density and economic intensity where the population exceeds
more than two million inhabitants.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Urban Development

The process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of
people living in an urban area through planned interventions in the area
in (1) the ownership and use of land, (2) the provision, maintenance and
upgrading of infrastructure and social services, and (3) the type and
intensity of economic activities.

Urban Edge

A line that is used as a border to distinguish between (1) an area/region
that is regarded as part of a city or town, and (2) its surrounding natural or
rural area. Its primary purpose is to ‘contain the urban’ and as such, (1) no
urban development is permitted, and (2) no municipal services are to be
provided outside/beyond the line. As in the case of a rural edge, the line
may have coordinates and be statutory, meaning it has binding legal
power, or be seen as a ‘fuzzy/soft line’, meaning its exact coordinates are
not defined, and it is to be used in a planning and policy sense and not as
a hard, impenetrable physical line.

Urbanisation

The process by which an increasing percentage of a country’s population
(1) moves to live in large towns and cities with the intention of staying there
or in a similar urban area, and not returning to the countryside, and (2) is
born in an urban area.

Water Scarce Regions

This construct refers to (1) the ‘climate capability’ of a region, which is a
function of the moisture supply, climate constraints and physiological
capacity of a region, and (2) the impact of climatic factors on the
capability to grow an agricultural crop in a region within a growth season.
For the purposes of the NSDF, areas described as ‘Water Scarce Regions’
fall within the ‘low to low-moderate’ climate capability ranges.

21
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This National Spatial Development Framework (NSDF), the first of its kind, seeks to
make a bold and decisive contribution to bringing about the peaceful, prosperous
and truly transformed South Africa, as articulated in the Freedom Charter, the
Reconstruction and Development Programme and the National Development Plan.
It does so in full recognition of:

The stranglehold that the unjust national spatial development paradigms,
logics and patterns of the past have placed on our many attempts at
breaking the back of poverty, unemployment and inequality;

The valuable, and often hard lessons we have learnt over the last twenty-
five years in our pursuit of national reconstruction, inclusive economic
growth and spatial transformation; and

The necessity for decisive, collaborative and targeted state action in
national space, to drive our country towards the shared, inclusive and
sustainable future we desire and require.

In accordance with this transformative agenda, and guided by the Spatial Planning
and Land Use Management Act, Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA), the NSDF consists of
seven interrelated parts:

Part One (1) provides an overview of the background to, need for and role
of the NSDF, (2) locates it within the context of the National Development
Plan (NDP), and (3) sets out the NSDF’s theory of change to move the
country from where we are, to the South Africa we want and need;

Part Two provides an overview of the process that was followed in the
compilation of the NSDF, including (1) the data that was gathered and
processed, (2) the work-sessions that were held, and (3) the consultations
and engagements that were undertaken;

Part Three provides a high-level overview of a series of significant national
spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities that impact
upon, and shape both (1) the national development landscape, and (2)
our ability to realise our national development goals;

Part Four (1) puts forward the national spatial development vision of a
shared and just South Africa, (2) sets out the ‘shifts’ that must be made in

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

the national spatial development logic based on the objectives and
directives of the NDP and the SPLUMA principles, to enable a radical,
transformative and decisive change in our national spatial development
pattern, (3) puts forward six national spatial development levers to give
spatial expression to the national spatial development vision, and support
the shifts that need to be made in accordance with the new national
spatial development logic, (4) provides a set of five required national spatial
outcomes to achieve the national development objectives, as outlined in
the NDP, and realise the national spatial development vision and desired
national spatial development pattern, as outlined in the NSDF, and (5) gives
an indication as to what life would be like in our country by 2050 if the vision
is pursued, the necessary shifts are made and the six national spatial
development levers are appropriately and effectively used;

Part Five provides national spatial development and investment guidance
in the form of (1) an ideal national spatial development pattern, (2) five
NSDF sub-frames, and (3) five national spatial action areas, to inform, direct
and guide all infrastructure investment and development spending
decisions by government and the private sector, to enable us to achieve
the desired national spatial development pattern for South Africa in 2050,
and in doing so, realise our national development objectives, as set out in
the NDP;

Part Six deals with the implementation of the NSDF, and (1) outlines the
measures, approach and actions required to realising our national spatial
development vision in a coherent, diligent and systematic way, and (2)
provides an overview of the role-players involved in doing so; and

Part Seven provides a summary of, and conclusion to the NSDF.

While the NSDF recognises the challenges involved in bringing about the
necessary changes in planning, budgeting and implementation in and
between the three spheres of government, it is also very clear as to their
importance in contributing to the joint crafting of our desired and shared future.

PART ONE: Introduction

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 
 1.1. Setting the Scene

In his first State of the Nation Address, President Cyril Ramaphosa, in
recognition of the exemplary struggle, conquest and spirit of our former
President Nelson Mandela, stated:

“In celebrating the centenary of Nelson Mandela, we are
not merely honouring the past, we are building the future.
We are continuing the long walk he began, to build a
society in which all may be free, in which all may be equal
before the law and in which all may share in the wealth of
our land and have a better life. We are building a country
where a person's prospects are determined by their own
initiative and hard work, and not by the colour of their skin,
place of birth, gender, language or income of their
parents”!

Transitioning a country like South Africa with its dreadful history and
stubbornly persistent legacy of the past into a better place for alll, is no
easy task, as was clearly articulated in the recently released report by
the High-Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and the
Acceleration of Fundamental Change, where it states the following:

“Colonialism and apartheid have left South Africa with a
deeply divided and inequitable distribution of people and
economic activity. This spatial inequality — traps
disadvantaged communities in poverty and
underdevelopment, creates inefficient cities, and robs
poor, rural people of secure livelihoods. The Panel makes
recommendations that seek to break this damaging spatial
pattern that is built on past laws, which marginalised the

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

black majority to the outskirts of the cities and to
Bantustans, to preserve key assets, economic opportunities
and the wealth of the country for the white minority. The
legacy of spatial inequality appears intractable despite
the National Development Plan and the Spatial Planning
and Land Use Management's (SPLUMA's) focus on it. This
issue needs an integrated solution that goes beyond the
mandate of any one government department or specific
level of government.”

The importance of space and land, and their densely interwoven
connections to economic development and livelihoods, was also
recognised in the Reconstruction and Development Programme in 1994,
where it was argued that:

1.2

“No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass
of our people remains in poverty, without land, without
tangible prospects for a better life. Attacking poverty and
deprivation must therefore be the first priority of a
democratic government."v

The National Transformation Logic & Space

Encapsulated in the three preceding powerful statements, is a ‘national
transformation logic’ with a distinct spatial dimension (see Figure 1),
which can be expressed as follows:

Our new,  post-Apartheid ‘national development
paradigm’, which includes (1) a set of progressive national
economic, social and spatial development objectives,
values and ideals, and (2) an enabling and supporting
national legal and policy framework, seeks to bring about

24
 a new, post-Apartheid future. Realising this desired future, (Section 1.3), which in turn is followed by a section (Section 1.4.3) in which

however, requires a new, post-Apartheid ‘national spatial the NSDF's theory of change is set out.
development logic’ and ‘national spatial development
vision’. Figure 1: The National Transformation Logic

outcome of the ‘national development paradigms’ and

Before getting to the NSDF’'s theory of change and the targeted,
coordinated and integrated (1) infrastructure investment and (2) social
and economic development expenditure it requires, it is important to get
asense of (1) what has been done, and (2) what we need to start doing,
stop doing, do more of, and do less of. This is done in the following section

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 25
 1.3. Taking Stock: National Spatial Development
and the need for a NSDF

In this section, the following are considered: (1) where we come from and
what needs to be undone, (2) what we have done and accomplished,
and (3) what more, or what else still needs to be done and undone. This
assessment is used to decide what changes we need to make, and the
way in which the NSDF intends doing so.

1.3.1 Where do we come from and what needs to be done
and undone?

In engaging the issues of ‘space’, ‘spatial planning’ and ‘land’, it is
important to recognise the spatial objectives and logic of the colonial
and Apartheid Eras, and their different, but equally divisive, underlying
economic and social logics.

(a) The Colonial Era

In terms of the colonial national development paradigm, all economic
activities (hunting, farming and mining) were done on land annexed by
force, or through unfair ‘deals’ that benefitted the colonial empire. The
resulting national spatial development logic consisted of railroads
connecting mines and large farming clusters in the interior to harbours at
the coast. From here, (1) commodities were exported, and (2) imports
(primarily manufactured goods) were received and carried by rail into
the interior. This logic laid the foundation for the country’s infrastructure
development pattern.

With the discovery of gold and diamonds, largely unplanned settlements

sprang up. In accordance with the prevailing colonial development
paradigm, these settlements were developed with only the benefit of the

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

colonists in mind. The indigenous population was (1) forcefully removed
rom their land to make place for the economic activities and related
settlements, and (2) economically coerced though taxation and loss of
land, to provide labour to white-owned farms, mines and industries to
make a living.

Land use and land development decisions were made only with the
benefit of the colonists in mind. Spatial planning legislation and policy
was ad hoc and responded to the immediate needs for regulation, order
and colonial exploitation and accumulation. In the rapidly-emerging
owns and cities, the resulting national spatial development pattern
consisted of racially-separated settlements in which white people
enjoyed (1) a privileged status, and (2) by and large, decent housing
conditions. Black people were denied choice, dignity and respect, and
reated as objects to support production by providing their labour at very
low wages, and forced into so-called “locations” on the outskirts of these
settlements.

 

(b) The Apartheid Era

The coming to power of the National Party in 1948, and the subsequent
introduction of the racist national development ideology/paradigm of
“Apartheid” brought about a new, carefully-conceived, — all-
encompassing set of laws and policies focused on systematic racial
segregation, exclusion and suppression. These laws and policies (1) built
on, (2) reinforced the exclusionary and exploitative national spatial
development logic, and (3) entrenched and deepened the unjust and
fragmented national spatial development pattern of the colonial era.
However, in contrast to (1) the earlier settler logic, ‘a new country’ was
now being crafted for the exclusive use and advancement of a white
‘South African’ minority, and (2) the earlier colonial era, indigenous
Africans were now not only viewed as a source of cheap labour, but also

26
 an increasingly vocal and numerically superior threat to ‘the new
country’ and its white minority. To overcome this threat and develop the
country, (1) the use of land and (2) the spatial relation of land-uses to
each other, became of strategic importance. The resulting ‘survive,
suppress and rule’ Apartheid national spatial development logic entailed
the location of ‘labour’ as far away as possible from the country’s
economic hubs, but still within ‘economically-feasible exploitation
distance’, i.e. as far away as the cost of rudimentary mass transport
would permit. This hideous pursuit at one point even entailed the
Apartheid planners considering locating “the next Soweto in the Karoo
and transporting ‘labour’ on a daily base by high-speed train to the then
Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vaal Triangle industrial and mining core”. At the
same time, increasingly draconic measures were introduced to destroy
any black economic endeavour that could compete with white mining,
farming, manufacturing and retail activities and interests. Again, land
was paramount in this pursuit, with (1) areas reserved for Black South
Africans being placed ever-further away (‘in the periphery’) from areas
of opportunity (‘the core’), (2) large-scale forced removals of Black South
Africans from where they were trying to access the opportunities offered
by urban South Africa, or trying to set up businesses in these areas, and
(3) areas set aside for Black occupation denied of any amenity or
opportunity for economic activity.

In contrast to the earlier colonial era, national spatial development
planning became the key means and driver for the creation and
deepening of the segregated and unequal apartheid state and country:
It was a country solely planned and built for the enjoyment and
advancement of a small white minority. The black majority, in turn, were
either (1) temporarily housed in “locations/townships”, or (2) forced to
stay in ethically-based Bantustans/homelands, and their movement to
and from these rural areas to urban areas forcefully regulated through
deeply oppressive measures, including the infamous passbook system.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Apartheid spatial planning and land allocation was not, as in colonial
times, a reactive response to land-related crises as and when they arose;
it was a core component and driver of the creation and organisation of
the racist social, economic and national spatial development logic of
the Apartheid State.

Over time, white South Africans living in towns and cities in Apartheid
South Africa, simply by owning land, saw their land ‘go’ from ‘land’ to
‘property’. This occurred through (1) the carefully planned parcelling,
surveying and registration of such land, (2) the servicing of this land with
public infrastructure (including social infrastructure such as schools and
hospitals for whites), and (3) the protection of the value and amenity of
such ‘properties’ and the suburbs in which they were located through
town planning legislation and building regulations. Through (1) spatial
planning and (2) land use control, white South Africans who owned land,
gained ‘property’, i.e. ‘land with a monetary value and with the potential
to increase such value’. From this base, white South Africans were able
to access opportunities in towns and cities, attend well-resourced, good
schools, and enter the job market in these or similar such places. In doing
so, reproducing the unjust social, economic and spatial development
pattern of wealth and privilege developed under the Apartheid system.

Black South Africans, in turn, who were able to get access to land, or
retain access to land, were at best left with land that had little value to
start with and quickly dwindled in value, due to (1) the spatial location of
such land, and (2) the low spatial quality and lack of complimentary
land-uses, amenities and economic activities in surrounding areas. It was
a case of planned, orchestrated and forcefully implemented ‘negative,
destructive spatial planning’. It actively disempowered Black South
Africans, making them worse off, and destroyed the attributes and
potential for any increase in property value that might have accrued to
them.

27
 This is the dreadful national spatial development pattern that democratic
South Africa inherited in 1994 - the outcome of more than 300 years of
unequal spatial investment and planning. It was, however, also the
spatial platform (1) on which, and (2) from which the country’s space
economy and society had to be transformed and a new country built.

1.3.2 What have we accomplished and what more needs
to be done?

Over the past twenty-five years, government has introduced several
acts, policies and programmes aimed at redressing the spatial legacies
of colonial and Apartheid rule. In most cases, these were directed at the
municipal level, with the newly created municipalities expected to pit
their limited ‘local’ planning and financial powers against the spatial
legacy of centrally-orchestrated and implemented apartheid spatial
planning and land-use allocation. In most instances, the impacts were
minimal. Old patterns were often reinforced, as new developments (such
as RDP housing) were built in peripheral areas on ‘readily available and
cheap land’. At the same time, the privileged spaces of Apartheid
largely remained ‘as is’, with the racial integration that took place,
focused in former white suburbs and new middle-to-higher income (1)
extensions to larger towns and cities, and/or (2) gated/barricaded
enclaves primarily in secondary cities and metropolitan areas.

In the national sphere, the Reconstruction and Development Programme
Office explored the idea of a National Spatial Development Framework
(1995-1996). Resistance from national sector departments and provincial
governments, who did not want their infrastructure investment and
development spending proposals interfered with, resulted in this plan
being dropped. Following on from this, the Office of the Deputy President
(and later the Presidency) introduced the National Spatial Development
Perspective (NSDP) (2000-2007), which sought to rationalise, harmonise

 

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

and integrate the investment and spending proposals of all government
sectors and spheres. The NSDP, in turn, was criticised (1) as being “neo-
liberal, urban-focused and anti-rural”, and (2) of “taking a too narrow a
view of development potential”. The NSDP was never used as envisaged
and fell out of favour.

Not much happened in the national planning space after the demise of
the NSDP until (1) the publication of the Green Paper on National
Strategic Planning in 2009, (2) the appointment of the first National
Planning Commission (NPC) in 2010, and (3) the subsequent preparation
and adoption of the 2030-National Development Plan (NDP) in 2012.

(a) The 2030-National Development Plan (NDP)

The NDP, is an all-encompassing comprehensive national development
plan that is grounded in:

e The ideals of the Freedom Charter;

e The tenets of the Reconstruction and Development Programme
(RDP); and

e The principles and directives of our Constitution.

The NDP (1) speaks to the multitude of needs and challenges facing the
country, their underlying causes and the factors inhibiting change, and
(2) provides detailed guidance on responding to all of these. To address
these challenges, which are all located in the inherited colonial and
apartheid space economy, the NDP puts forward a series of proposals
resting on “six pillars”, i.e.:

e Uniting all South Africans around a common programme to
achieve prosperity and equity:

e Promoting active citizenry to strengthen development,
democracy and accountability:

28
 e Bringing about faster economic growth, higher investment and
greater labour absorption;

e Focusing on the key capabilities of people and the state;

e Building a capable and developmental state; and

e Encouraging strong leadership throughout society to work
together to solve problems.

The NDP recognises that overcoming our triple challenges of inequality,
unemployment and poverty lies in transforming our physical space. In
doing so, it recognises that tackling the triple challenges means:

e Fundamentally disrupting and undoing inherited and persisting
(1) colonial and apartheid economic, social and spatial
investment logics, and (2) their resultant spatial forms and land-
use patterns, which in turn impede inclusive economic growth
and spatial transformation;

e Making radical changes in and to space; and

e Introducing a national inclusionary economic growth and spatial
transformation-focused investment and spending logic that all
spheres and sectors of government can (1) buy into, (2) drive
forward, and (3) be assessed on in terms of the outcomes of their
actions.

The NDP furthermore recognises that while transformation-focused
action is required throughout our country, and in every sector and sphere
of government, it is only through radical and decisive intervention that is
coherently planned for, and managed aft the national scale, that we
stand a chance at (1) disrupting the Apartheid spatial logic and space
economy, and (2) overcoming the inequities, isolation, fragmentation
and costly and disruptive travel distances brought about by colonialism
and Apartheid.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

It is especially Chapter 8 of the NDP — “Transforming Human Settlement
and the National Space Economy” - that makes specific reference to
the need for a “national spatial development framework”. Such a
framework, it holds, must optimise, integrate and coordinate the energies
and economic impacts of the strategic interventions in national space.
Such ‘national spatial framing’, in turn, is recognised as of crucial
importance, given the significance of soace and access to land in (1)
bringing about transformation at scale, and (2) ensuring that people and
places benefit from this intervention. The chapter also includes a
“proposed national schema for spatial targeting” (see Figure 2) and (1)
sets out a series of directives for such a framework, and (2) proposes that
it be provided for in national legislation.

 Following on from this guidance, government prepared spatial and land-
related policy and legislation that speaks to, and gives further expression
to (especially) Chapter 8 of the NDP. These instruments, which cover (1)
settlement planning, (2) place-making, and (3) land-use and land-use
management, are the 2016-Integrated Urban Development Framework
(IUDF) and the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013
(SPLUMA).

(b) The Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF)”

The IUDF, South Africa's national urban policy, takes as one of its key
drivers the NDPs requirement that South Africa should see meaningful
and measurable progress in the pursuit of more functionally integrated,
balanced and vibrant settlements. It builds on, and responds to a variety
of chapters in the NDP, but notably Chapter 8. This is evident in its guiding
vision of “liveable, safe, resource-efficient cities and towns that are
socially integrated, economically inclusive and globally competitive,
and where residents actively participate in urban life”.

The IUDF puts forward a “new deal” for South Africa's cities and towns,
which it sees as being on a continuum, ranging from the very large
metropolitan regions to the smallest towns in rural South Africa. This new
deal entails (1) maximising the potential of urban areas, and (2)
integrating planning, budgeting and investment in such a way that it
improves and enhances urban form and improves the performance or
urban areas. The IUDF makes a strong case for:

e Working with and sharing the urban spaces built up during
colonial and Apartheid times; and

e ‘Retrofitting’ our urban spaces to optimise their footprint and
produce compact, coordinated and well-connected cities and
towns.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

The IUDF puts forward “four strategic goals” for all urban areas, i.e. (1)
spatial integration, (2) inclusion and access, (3) growth, and (4)
governance, and proposes “nine policy levers” to achieve these goals.
These are:

e Integrated urban planning and management;
e Integrated transport and mobility;

e Integrated and sustainable human settlements;
e Integrated urban infrastructure;

e — Efficient land governance and management;
e Inclusive economic development;

e Empowered active communities;

e Effective urban governance; and

e Sustainable finances.

The IUDF furthermore introduces three “cross-cutting priorities” that are to
be used in the conceptualisation and implementation of the nine policy
levers. These are: (1) rural-urban interdependency, (2) urban resilience,
and (3) urban safety. While making strong, guiding statements in the
pursuit of shared, inclusive, resilient and liveable urban settlements, the
IUDF cautions against a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it recognises
that South Africa has different types of cities and towns that perform
different roles, and have different requirements.

The IUDF has a multi-faceted implementation plan, including short-term
interventions. These require the active participation of a range of
stakeholders, including all three spheres and sectors of government, the
private sector, NGOs, NPOs and local community organisations. The |UDF
is also being used to prepare South Africa's “Localisation Framework” for
implementation of the global Urban Agenda - in this way advancing the
global pursuit of SDG Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlement
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.

30
 (c) The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, Act 16 of
2013 (SPLUMA)

SPLUMA was introduced to “provide a framework for spatial planning
and land use management” in South Africa. As such, it not only seeks to
attend to and rectify the fragmented, unequal and unfair apartheid
planning system inherited from the Apartheid era, but also its
consequences in space. As in the case of the IUDF, this means the active
pursuit of (1) spatial transformation and (2) social and economic
inclusion, to ensure equal access for all to the services, amenities and
opportunities that well-planned, well-functioning and well-managed
urban and rural settlements offer. Core in this regard is the introduction of
single, uniform spatial planning and land use management systems in
municipal areas that include places previously excluded from such
systems. Being framework legislation, it seeks to provide “principles,
guidance and norms and standards” for planning in the provincial and
municipal spheres of government. The five “principles”, which must be
adhered to, pursued, and observed in all actions undertaken in terms of
the Act, are “spatial justice, spatial sustainability, efficiency, spatial
resilience and good administration”.

SPLUMA furthermore:

e Mandates the preparation of “Spatial Development Frameworks”
(SDFs) by all three soheres of government, including the “National
Spatial Development Framework";

e Provides for the preparation of “Regional Spatial Development
Frameworks"; and

e Distinguishes between (1) spatial planning and (2) land use
management, and establishes a link between the two.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Being located within the Constitutional realm of cooperative
governance, these frameworks are not positioned in a hierarchical order,
but instead as interdependent planning instruments that require
intergovernmental collaboration and integration in their preparation,
review and implementation.

(d) Summary

Assessing what has been done and accomplished over the last twenty-
four years in terms of the National Transformation Logic (Section 1.2 and
Figure 1), the verdict clearly is that much has been done:

With regards to the national development paradigm, the (1) Constitution
and (2) Cabinet-adopted NDP provide the foundation, and strategic
direction for government to respond to our inter-related triple challenges
of inequality, unemployment and poverty. These are supported by a
series of (1) enabling acts and policies, (2) solid sector plans and
programmes, and (3) strategic infrastructure investment programmes,
which include the New Growth Path, the Industrial Policy Framework and
Industrial Policy Action Plans, the Strategic Integrated Projects, the
National Transport Master Plan 2050 and a range of national plans for
human settlement.

With regards to the national spatial development logic, Chapter 8 of the
NDP, and the IUDF and SPLUMA frame, mandate, allow and guide the
changes that need to be made in:

e Ourspace economy, in terms of (1) what we do, where and why,
(2) which resources we use, and how we use them, and (3) who
participates in, and benefits and gains from these activities; and

3]
 e Oursettlements, in terms of (1) how, and with what outcomes in
mind, we plan and invest as a country, (2) how and where we
provide which services, and (3) how we sustain these services.

This they do by enabling:

e The use of spatial development planning to integrate and
optimise all public and private sector infrastructure and
investment spending proposals in space, both (1) in the national
interest, and (2) to the advantage of local spaces and those who
live their lives in these spaces; and

e The radical, decisive and sustainable transformation of our
settlements into productive, liveable and resilient places for alll,
through (1) wise spatial planning and land-use planning,
development and management, and (2) the provision of access
to land, economic opportunities and all the other amenities and
opportunities that good, quality settlements offer.

However, when considering the national spatial development pattern,
and the national social and economic interactions, and as echoed in
numerous government reports, academic papers and the printed and
social media, despite these components being in place, the stubborn
persistence of the colonial and Apartheid spatial development patterns
suggests that something is amiss. While much has been done and
achieved in the ambit of legislation and policy, not that much change
has been (1) felt in the daily lives of people, or (2) seen on the ground.

Leading on from the National Transformation Logic, as set out in Section
1.2, it would follow that this ‘change-deficit’ could be due to:

e There being a new national development vision, as provided by

the NDP, but not anew and/or broadly accepted post-Apartheid
national spatial development vision;

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

e The enabling and supporting legislation and policy no? being
adhered to and/or implemented (1) in the way that they are
meant to be, including not in an integrated, coordinated and
targeted way, and/or (2) without a collective, national focus on
the crucial issues of ‘land’ and ‘space’;

e Not enough time having passed for the necessary transformatory
changes to have been made in terms of the legal and policy
framework, and/or their effects to be felt in space (notably in the
case of the 2013-SPLUMA and the 2016-IUDF); and/or

e The national spatial development logic not having changed from
its earlier colonial and Apartheid versions, and/or its transition to
a post-Apartheid national spatial development logic not being
actively pursued and/or enforced.

Lending from a large evidence base of government reviews, reports,
assessments and academic papers, notably the recent High-Level Panel
Review and the 2018-World Bank Report on South Africa, if is argued that
all of the above explanations are at play. At the same time, another
possibility is put forward, i.e. that while there is agreement as to what we
want to move from in terms of past national spatial development
patterns, there is not clarity and/or agreement as to what the desired
post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern should look like.
Without such spatial clarity and guidance, public investments are made
in accordance with (1) sector-driven objectives, targets and outcomes,
and/or (2) place/territorially-based concerns and challenges, without
consideration for the national transformative impact.

It is here where the NSDF seeks to intervene...

Given the newness of an intervention like the NSDF for our country,
international precedent and experience with such national-level
planning instruments is briefly engaged, before moving on to the NSDF.

32
 1.3.3. International Precedent and Experience

Internationally, national spatial planning with typically a twenty fo thirty-
year time horizon, has primarily been a feature of:

e Smaller European countries, notably the Netherlands and
Denmark, and more recently Ireland, Albania, Serbia, Slovenia,
Iceland, Estonia, Wales, Scotland, Portugal and Romania;

e Developmental states in Asia, notably China, Singapore,
Malaysia and South Korea; and

e African countries at two different stages, i.e. (1) shortly after
independence, and, in more recent times, (2) before or during a
rapid growth phase as in the case of Ghana, Kenya, Uganda,
Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana and Tanzania.

In most cases, such planning is associated with (1) more unitary states
where the mandate and role of national planning in such arenas is either
not, or less contested, and (2) countries where such planning is viewed in
a favourable light due to its link to national economic planning and
growth, especially the triggering of such growth. The mood of the time
and the ideological home of the national governing party is also
important. For example, in times of greater national and/or global
support for state involvement in the economy, and/or tighter monetary
conditions, such planning has generally been more welcomed. Likewise,
the support for spatial planning, and especially national spatial planning,
has (1) ebbed in accordance with the election of more pro-market, neo-
liberal parties, and (2) risen with the election of parties that hold a more
favourable view of state or developmental intervention in the economy.

The mere existence of such national spatial plans, strategies or
frameworks has not necessarily meant that they (1) were implemented,
or (2) had the desired impact. In many cases, the notion of one ‘super-
plan’ imposing itself on the mandates of other sectors in the national tier

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

of government and/or in sub-national tiers of government has not been
welcomed. Furthermore, given that such instruments often have
coordinating, integrating and guiding functions, and do not have their
own budgets, they have struggled to secure buy-in and support. In other
cases, (1) failure to fund, or (2) deliberately withholding funding from the
entity responsible for the preparation and/or implementation of the
instrument, for whatever reason, has seen it have little else but a life on
paper and/or a website. Finally, the power, status and ‘popularity’ of the
department or entity responsible for the instrument and/or the
politician(s) responsible for or involved with it, has played an important
role in its acceptance and use.

Where such instruments have worked, this has in most instances been due
to:

e The entity preparing it, managing to secure strong support from
the outset of the preparation process for the instrument both in
and outside of government;

e Political will, coupled with decisive and capable state action;

e Astrong and vocal technical lobby of planners, researchers and
academics supporting it; and/or

e Aclear, tangible need for it, and a prevailing sense amongst the
population at large that it could make a meaningful difference
in (1) the fortunes of the country, and (2) their lives.

33
 1.4 The NSDF as Tool for National Spatial
Development and Transformation

1.4.1 The NSDF’s Mandate

In terms of government policy, Chapter 8 of the NDP calls for the
preparation of a “national spatial development framework”. In terms of
legislation, Section 5(3) (a) of SPLUMA provides for, and Sections 13(1) and
(2) of the Act mandate the Minister to, “... after consultation with other
organs of state and with the public, compile and publish a national
spatial development framework” and review it at least once every five
years.

1.4.2 The NSDF’s Purpose, Focus and Content

Section 13(3) specifies that the National Spatial Development Framework
(NSDF) must consider:

e All policies, plans and programmes of public and private bodies
that impact on spatial planning, land development and land use
management;

e Any matter relevant to the coordination of such policies, plans
and programmes that impact on spatial planning, land
development and land use management; and

e All representations submitted to the Minister in respect of the
framework.

Section 14 sets out the content of the NSDF, and indicates that the
framework must:

e Give effect to the development principles and norms and
standards set out in the Act;

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

e Give effect to all relevant national policies, priorities, plans and
legislation;

e Coordinate and integrate provincial and municipal SDFs;

e Enhance spatial coordination and land use management
activities at national level;

e Indicate desired patterns of land use in the country; and

e Take cognisance of any environmental management instrument
adopted by the relevant environmental management authority.

Section 12(1), which also deals with the SDFs of provincial governments
and municipalities, specifies that the NSDF must:

e Interpret and represent the spatial development vision of the
national sphere of government;

e Beinformed by along-term spatial development vision statement
and plan;

e Represent the integration and trade-off of all relevant national
sector policies and plans;

e Guide planning and development across all sectors of the
national sphere of government;

e Contribute to a coherent, planned approach to spatial
development in the three spheres of government;

e Provide clear and accessible information to the public and
private sector, and provide direction for investment purposes;

e Include previously disadvantaged areas, areas under traditional
leadership, rural areas, informal settlements, slums and
landholdings of State-Owned Enterprises and government
agencies, and ensure their inclusion and integration into the
spatial, economic, social and environmental objectives of the
national sphere of government;

e Address historical spatial imbalances in development;

34
 e Identify the long-term risks of particular spatial patterns of growth
and development and the policies and strategies necessary to
mitigate those risks;

e Provide direction for strategic developments and infrastructure
investment, promote efficient, sustainable and planned
investments by all sectors, and indicate priority areas for
investment in land development;

e Promote a rational and predictable land developmen
environment to create trust and stimulate investment;

e Give effect to national legislation and policies on minera
resources, and the sustainable utilisation and protection of
agricultural resources; and

e Consider, and where necessary, incorporate the outcomes oO
substantial public engagement in the framework.

Section 12(2)(a) specifies that the three spheres of government mus
participate in the spatial planning processes that impact on each other,
to ensure that their plans and programmes are coordinated, consisten
and in harmony with each other.

 

Section 12(2)(b) specifies that the NSDF must guide and inform the
exercise of any discretion of, or any decision taken in terms of the Act, or
any other law relating to land use and development of land by the
national sphere of government.

Section 12(3) specifies that the NSDF must contribute to and give spatial
expression to national development policy and plans, as well as integrate
and give spatial expression to policies and plans emanating from the
various sectors of national government, and may include any “Regional
Spatial Development Framework”.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Section 12(6) specifies that the NSDF must outline specific arrangements
for prioritising, mobilising, sequencing and implementing public and
private infrastructural and land development investment in the priority
spatial structuring areas identified in the framework.

In summary, as indicated in Figure 3 (below), the NSDF must, within the
broader ‘family’ of strategic and sector plans of government:

e Target and direct all infrastructure investment and development
spending decisions by all national sector departments and State-
Owned Enterprises (SOEs);

e Guide and align plan preparation, budgeting and
implementation across spheres and between sectors of
government; and

e Frame and coordinate provincial, regional and municipal spatial
development frameworks.

1.4.3 The NSDF’s Theory of Change

Based on (1) the National Transformation Logic as set out in Section 1.2,
(2) the gaps and explanations as identified in the stock-taking exercise in
Section 1.3, and (3) the legal requirements regarding the NSDF as set out
Section 1.4.2, the NSDF’s Theory of Change to move our country to the
desired Post-Apartheid future, is as follows:

e Step 1: The existing national development paradigm, including
the Constitution, the NDP and the existing legal and policy
framework, notably SPLUMA and the IUDF, is used to:

Articulate a compelling and persuasive post-Apartheid
spatial development logic and identify the ‘shifts’ from the
old and existing logics that this new logic requires; and
Craft a strong and credible post-Apartheid national
spatial development vision;

35
 e Step 2: The new logic and vision is used together with an analysis
of the current and unfolding ‘national spatial development
landscape’, to develop a set of national spatial development
levers, and craft a desired post-Apartheid national spatial
development pattern;

e Step 3: The post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern
is used to indicate what actions, interventions and priority actions
are required to ensure transition to this desired pattern;

e Step 4: The post-Apartheid national spatial development pattern
and interventions and priority actions are used to prepare clear
implementation guidance for realising the desired national
spatial transformation; and

e Step 5: The spatial development guidance, tasks and actions as
set out in the NSDF are implemented, and (1) movement towards
the realisation of the desired post-Apartheid national spatial
development pattern monitored and assessed, and (2) corrective

 PART TWO: The Draft NSDF Preparation Process

 
 2.1 Introduction

The process of preparing the first NSDF for South Africa started in April
2014. The formulation of the Draft NSDF comprised Phases 3 and 4 of the
process, as indicated in Figure 5.

2.2. Preparatory Work and Research Phase

The first two phases of the NSDF compilation process started with the
preparation of the “NSDF Concept Document” by the Department of
Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), which set the parameters
for the remainder of the process. This was followed by an intensive
process of research into thematic areas that (1) influence, and (2) are
influenced by, the spatial legacies and dynamics of the South African
landscape. The Thematic Research Reports provided the basic
diagnostic for the NSDF, and focused on:

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

e Population dynamics, migration and people;

e Human settlements;

e Social infrastructure;

e Natural resources and the environment;

e Movement and transport;

e The national space economy; and

e Unemployment, labour, education and skills development, with
an emphasis on rural development, land reform and agriculture.

At the outset of the NSDF process, the NSDF Technical Working Group
(TWG) was established as a multistakeholder forum including
representatives from (1) national sector departments, (2) Offices of the
Premier and provincial sector departments involved in planning, (3) SOEs,
and (4) relevant government agencies and organisations.

2.3. Spatial Analysis and Proposals Phase

The third phase of the process, i.e. Spatial Analysis and Proposals, was
conducted in a series of work-streams, as follows:

2.3.1 Foundational Work

The focus of this work-stream was to (1) establish the most significant
global, national and inter-regional spatial development opportunities
and challenges, and (2) develop a draft national spatial vision and set of
national spatial development levers. Foundational work was also done
for the Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)-process.
Engagements in this phase included (1) NSDF Steering Committee
meetings, (2) introductory presentations to the NSDF TWG, (3) expert
inputs, (4) bilateral meetings with selected sector departments, and (5)
an online survey conducted with planning professionals.

40
 2.3.2 Preliminary Sharing and Testing

The focus of this work-stream was on sharing and testing (1) the list of
national opportunities and challenges, and (2) the draft proposals
prepared in the Foundational work-stream. With this objective in mind, a
‘Consolidated Draft Discussion Document’ was compiled, to enable (1)
a focused discussion with, and (2) the sourcing of inputs, comments and
proposals from national and provincial government departments,
municipalities, SOEs, the NPC, the South African Local Government
Association (SALGA) and stakeholder organisations, such as the South
African Cities Network (SACN). Work-sessions were also held with the
NSDF TWG and provincial officials responsible for the preparation and
review of PSDFs, and submissions made to the NPC.

2.4 Draft NSDF Phase

This phase entailed (1) fhe preparation of the ‘first Draft NSDF’ based on
the outputs of the previous work-streams and the inputs, comments and
proposal made during these phases, and (2) structured engagement on
the Draft NSDF, as provided for in SPLUMA (see Figure 6). These
engagements included:

e Apresentation to the NPC;

e Apresentation to, and work session with the TWG;

e Provincial workshops in all nine provinces involving stakeholders
from municipalities, provincial departments and the private
sector; and

e Bilateral engagements with national sector departments.

The Draft NSDF was revised and amended based on (1) further data-

gathering and analyses, and (2) inouts and comments made during the
engagement sessions, and written submissions received after the events.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

It is envisaged that this ‘new Draft NSDF’ will be engaged both further
and wider, and include the ‘sixty-day public commenting period’, as
prescribed in Section 13(4)(b) of SPLUMA.

2.5 Cabinet Submission Phase
The final phase will entail the preparation of (1) the ‘Final Draft NSDF’ for

Cabinet Submission, taking cognisance of public comments and inputs,
and (2) the documentation, as required in terms of the SEIAS-process.

 PART THREE: National Spatial Development Shapers

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019
 3.1. Introduction

A wide and diverse range of (1) national spatial development realities
and (2) international, national and sub-national trends, flows and
patterns impact upon, and shape both the national development
landscape, and our ability to realise our national development goals.

Part Three of the NSDF provides some insights into these inter-related
national spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities. It
draws on, and highlights aspects as raised in and by:

e An extensive diagnostic conducted in the earlier stages of the
preparation of the NSDF, and captured in a ‘Consolidated
Research Report’ (see Section 2.2);

e  Supra-national, national and provincial development plans,
policies, frameworks and overviews;

e National discourses, newspaper reports, books and book
chapters, journal and magazine articles, and published and
unpublished research reports; and

e Modelled spatial implications of a series of population growth
and climate change scenarios.

The NDP objectives, SPLUMA principles and NSDF vision statement were
used in an iterative way as lens to (1) ‘read’ the South African national
spatial development and planning landscape, and (2) identify key
national spatial development dynamics, challenges and opportunities.
From this analysis, ten ‘shapers’ of national spatial settlement and
development were put together. These shapers are discussed in Sections
3.2 to 3.12 below. In each case, the scale and extent of ‘the shaper’, and
its implications for (1) national space, (2) the national space economy
and/or (3) national spatial governance are highlighted, and connections

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

to other shapers highlighted. Interspersed between the ten shapers are a
series of thematically-structured ‘Info Charts’ under the following themes:

e People and Places;

e Ecologies, Economies and Spaces;

e Institutions and Services; and

e Movements, Connections and Flows

These charts capture and present in visual form key information pieces
and elements, as referred to under the shapers. The section is concluded
with a summary (see Section 3.12) of the most significant national spatial
development challenges and opportunities extracted from the ten
shapers.

3.2. Demographic Shifts, Dividends, Vulnerabilities
and Diversity

In the next 31 years, the South African population will grow by at least
another 17 million people, from around 58 million people in 2018, to
around 75 million by 2050. In addition to a population that will be 30%
larger than we currently have, it is anticipated that (1) it will primarily be
an urban-based population, and (2) at least 30 million of the 75 million
South Africans (40%) are likely to be living below the Minimum Living Level
(MLL).

In terms of composition, the very youthful South African population of
today (28% of the population is below 15 years of age) will by 2050 still be
regarded as young, with 25% of the population below 15 years of age,
and 31% between 15 and 34 years of age, and in their primary
childbearing years. The share of the population that will be ‘65 years of
age and older’ will also have experienced significant growth, by 2050
constituting 8% of the population, i.e. 6 million people, which is nearly

ae
 double the 3.2 million people that were ‘65 years of age and older’ in
2018. This group will require increasingly more health and frail care and
income support from households, communities and the State. This will of
course open up and create a large number of job opportunities for frail
and health care workers, many of which may be created in rural areas,
if this is where, as anticipated, most of those above 65 years of age will
choose to live.

Given that the bulk of the envisaged youthful population will be living in
urban areas, it will potentially present the country with a ‘dynamic-triple-
dividend’: (1) a large, dynamic, creative and innovative economically
active population living at high densities in a few large places,
constituting (2) a large, densely connected consumer market for goods
and services, and (3) a far more accepting and accommodating
approach to difference and diversity, which will be especially important
in the large urban conurbations of the future. It is especially the higher
densities at which our people will be living, coupled with the greater
need to co-produce and collaborate in such spaces, that may create
and instil a different view of each other - more accepting and more
celebratory of difference, and more mindful of the contribution that
different individuals and groups can make fo resolving a challenge or
problem in an innovative and sustainable way.

This ‘dynamic-triple-dividend’ is, however, not a given, and may not
materialise, in which case our youth could become a very volatile and
destructive force. Should this youthful population (1) be raised in a caring
environment with adequate food, love and care, (2) be well-educated
and (3) be well-integrated in society, the ‘full’ dividend is more likely to
materialise. Should the opposite prevail, as is currently the case for large
numbers of our youth growing up in deeply impoverished rural areas and
townships, only parts of the dividend, or none of it at all will be realised,
with severely negative consequences. As for the greater acceptance of
difference and diversity, should (1) scarcity, and (2) an unwillingness to

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

share the little that is available prevail, this dividend will also not
materialise. In such an event, our urban areas could very likely see more
of the xenophobia and other forms of hatred of ‘those who are seen to
be different’, and this will be to the detriment of our cities transitioning
into dynamic cosmopolitan economic powerhouses.

Merely hoping that the dynamic-triple-dividend will materialise by itself,
especially given our historically high levels of poverty and inequality, is
not a sensible strategy. To realise the ‘full’ dividend will require that it be
actively pursued, with the State playing a critical role in this regard.
Support for nutrition programmes, housing, care and access to
economic opportunities for our youth will need to be attended to. All
State plans will also need to be prepared with an emphasis on youth and
diversity. At the same time, those national spatial development patterns
and settlement forms that will be better at (1) eliciting the dividend and
(2) allowing it to flourish, will need to be pursued. These include (1)
developing urban settlements at higher densities, (2) greater mixing of
land-uses, and (3) greater accessibility to the services that successful,
well-connected, dynamic urban areas offer.

 3.3 Urbanisation, the Pursuit of a Better Life and a
Desire for Quality Urban Living and Spaces

Urbanisation, meaning both (1) the movement of our people from rural
to urban areas, and (2) the increase in the percentage of our population
living in urban areas, will continue Unabatedly throughout the three
decades up to 2050. According to United Nations-estimates, “... 71.3% of
the South African population will live in urban areas by 2030, reaching
nearly 80% by 2050." National population projections for medium and
high-growth scenarios (considering population growth as well as
international migration patterns) conducted to explore future climate
change scenarios, illustrate the need to plan for at least a 30% increase
in our urban population by 2050v. In the same vein, the CSIR’s
‘Downscaled Settlement Locational Modelling-exercise’ projects that
under ‘a scenario with no radical intervention’, approximately 85% of
South Africa's population will be living in urban agglomerations by 2050.

Our three urban regions (Gauteng, Western Cape and eThekwini) will
experience the largest increases in population — this being from natural
growth, as well as in-migration from South Africa, SADC and further afield.
Significant movement will also take place from villages and small towns
to larger, better connected towns located on major transport routes
where provision of better and more reliable basic services, education,
healthcare and policing are, and will remain, important drivers of
migration. However, while small towns and dense rural settlements are
not expected to see a large population growth, they are also not
expected fo see a significant population decline in either the medium-
scale or high-growth scenarios for population growth in South Africa. As
such, both large urban regions and rural areas will require targeted and
appropriate government focus and attention.

Given the presence of a young, educated, vocal and demanding urban
electorate of around 65 million people by 2050, making good on the
promise of a better life for all, will be a major concern for government.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

This will especially be the case in large urban regions, where these large
populations will place huge demands on already over-burdened,
collapsing and ageing municipal infrastructure. At the same time, these
areas will need to rapidly increase their contribution to the country’s
formal economic output and tax income, and become (1) the sites of
‘spatial transformation’ and ‘drivers of inclusive and sustainable
economic growth’ at scale, and (2) the incubators of dynamic, creative,
and innovative new economies. Municipalities will not be able to carry
this burden alone and will require significant financial and technical
support from (1) national and provincial government, and (2) the private
sector. Long-term planning for urban growth, including the identification
of suitable land, land reform planning, land-use management, and the
preparation of infrastructure master plans with full life-cycle costing, will
be imperative.

Ways of urban life and living are also likely to undergo radical change,
with urban inhabitants increasingly (1) seeking, finding and making ways
of making a life for themselves, and (2) becoming far more involved in
making better quality urban spaces in what will for most be their only
home. This ‘drive from below’ will be fuelled by (1) a far more active
citizenry, in part driven by necessity, (2) a much smaller ‘large-sized
private sector’, severely bruised by dwindling disposable household
incomes and a slow-to-change capital-intensive business model unsuited
to an increasingly-faster changing business environment, and (3) the
scale of the challenge in relation to the State's finances and capacity to
deliver services and assist in this regard. This ‘drive from below’ will also
lead to a relaxation of bylaws and (1) far less petty and far more high-
level land use regulations, enabling far greater levels of economic
activity and agility, and far more organic and inclusive economic
growth, (2) far greater diversity in economic activities, housing forms and
tenure types, (3) far more horizontal and vertical mixing of land uses, (4)
far higher settlement densities, and (5) far more vibrant and lively city
streets.

51
 The gaps in State service provision will very likely open up opportunities
for entrepreneurial endeavour, notably in the provision of housing, water,
energy, health care and education. The greater availability of urban
land for settlement, through urban land reform, will also see a rapid
increase in the number of new small-scale property developers.
Altogether, these new forms of urban living and urban spaces will
become the new drivers of innovation, creativity and job creation and
societal transformation from below and cement large urban areas as the
most important contributors to the South African economy. This will not
only be done through the collective endeavours of millions of individual
actors and small and micro-sized enterprises in the economy, but also by
the contribution of innovative and agile large companies competing
successfully in the global economy.

An increase in cross-border trade and the rendering of personal,
financial, education and health services in border-region towns, will see
an increase in movement by South Africans and citizens from other
African countries, to such towns. Given the envisaged changes in urban
areas towards places of far greater vibrancy, diversity and respect for
difference, and their global connectivity, the larger urban areas will
experience significant in-migration of people from primarily other African
countries, but also from further afield.

In the sprawling, dense rural areas along (1) the eastern escarpment of
the country in Limpopo and Mpumalanga, (2) the eastern KwaZulu-Natal
and Eastern Cape coastal strip, and (3) the north-western mining and
agricultural region running from the Northwest to the Northern Cape, the
trend towards far greater densification in nodes and along routes
connecting such nodes, will continue and result in far more concentrated
development and the release of agricultural land for productive use in
these areas.

Smaller towns in rural areas will also experience sizeable counter-
urbanisation, as growing numbers of retiring middle-income South
Africans from urban areas will settle for more tranquil lives in the rural parts
of our country. This will, in many such settlements, facilitate (1) the

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

construction and upgrading of houses by individuals and families for this
anticipated retirement stage, as well as (2) the tailor-made development
of housing units catering for this older population in such towns, which will
support the growth of a new generation of small-to-medium sized
property developers in these towns. The injection of the regular pensions
of these new, retired inhabitants will also (1) stimulate the local economy,
by creating a new market for local produce and personal and social
services, notably the provision of health and frail care services, and (2)
provide valuable and stable municipal rates and tax incomes. This move
to rural South Africa will also be strengthened and facilitated in many
villages and smaller towns by the rapid release of land in such towns
through the national land reform programme.

Quality urban living in both urban and rural areas will require just and
sustainable access to social services. The provision of such services (1)
requires investment in ‘social infrastructure’, i.e. ‘high-quality facilities that
are well-equipped, maintained and operated, and staffed to the correct
level by well-trained personnel who provide a range of critical social
services to the community’, and (2) include the full soectrum of health
and education services, citizen registration, welfare support, cultural and
sport and recreational facilities. While no comprehensive overview of
backlogs in the provision of these services is available at national level,
local case-studies show critical shortages and grossly inadequate service
delivery in both rural and urban areas. These include (1) poor
maintenance of buildings, (2) a shortage of equipment, and (3) critical
staff shortages, especially with respect to well-trained and dedicated
staff. The projected national population increase to 75 million people by
2050, however, not only means expanded requirements for social facility
investment and operation, but also (1) presents an opportunity for
meaningful employment in rural fowns, and (2) if properly planned and
provided, can act as a highly effective and sustainable economic
multiplier. The importance of spatial planning to guide targeted social
infrastructure investment can, however, not be over-emphasised —
establishing a sound spatial-location-logic that optimises human capital

52
 development with economic impact, is imperative to address inequality
and ensure inter-generational justice.

3.4 Ruralisation and the Need for Decisive and
Sustainable Rural Development and Agrarian
Reform

Currently more than 17 million of our people are estimated to be living in
rural settlements across dense and sparsely populated regions — mainly
in the former Bantustans. Most of these people live in conditions of severe
poverty and vulnerability. Research on these conditions shows that ‘...
the deprivation gap between those living in the former homelands and
the rest of the country has not narrowed in the period between 2001 and
2011', meaning that well-intended investment and rural development
initiatives for over a decade or more have not significantly changed this
picture of relative deprivation in these areas“,

However, after (1) hundreds of years of colonial and Apartheid
oppression, exploitation, disregard and calculated under-investment, (2)
followed by decades of uncoordinated and fragmented investment by
successive post-Apartheid governments in rural South Africa, these areas
are finally getting the recognition, respect and focused ‘development
attention’ they deserve and have been promised since 1994. This trend
towards taking rural areas seriously is set to continue and become
stronger over the next three decades, as rural areas become recognised
as parts of our country that are (1) areas of national significance for
surface water and food production and the provision of key national
ecosystem services, (2) still ‘home’ to millions of South Africans, many of
them highly vulnerable and isolated from the broader national economy,
(3) places of retreat, rest and connection with nature and cultural
practices, far away from fast-paced urban lives, and (4) sought-after
domestic and international tourism and retirement destinations. In terms

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

of State action, focused rural development is set to find expression in (1)
targeted agrarian reform, (2) tenure reform, (3) the development of agri-
processing and logistic support-hubs, (4) diversification of the local
economy, (5) small-town redevelopment and regeneration in accessible
locations, (6) Public works-led job creation programmes and the roll-out
of core government social and municipal services, and (7) the provision
of grant support with the building and upgrading of housing, specifically
in identified regional development anchors and rural service towns.

Of crucial importance to the realisation of the desired rural development
objectives is rural land reform, which will release vast amounts of under-
utilised commercial agricultural and State-owned land for use by new
entrants to the farming sector, and give the resurgence and upliftment
of rural areas a huge impetus. The new rural economy will, however,
necessitate the development of a very different local economy in those
towns built up over generations and sustained by a model of either large-
scale commercial agriculture or subsistence agriculture. New agriculture
support entities, cooperatives, equipment, fertilizer, market support,
funding and research will need to be introduced in towns in rural areas
to support a new type of farmer. Municipalities, who will have to ensure
new and appropriate land management in such areas, may also be
expected and/or called upon to assist new role-players in the local
economy with establishing new agricultural and non-agricultural-related
economic activities. In this, they will require very specific support from the
national and provincial sector departments responsible for agriculture
and rural development, who will themselves also have to take on new
roles in the light of the new dawn in rural South Africa.

Rural communities will increasingly also demand better levels and higher
speeds of connectivity, both by road and rail, and by broadband. At the
same time, demands will be placed on government for the provision of
quality social, education, health and police services, placing significant
pressure on what will, for at least the next decade, be a severely

53.
 constrained fiscus. As alluded to earlier, it is imperative that such services
be provided in such places and in such a manner that they (1) have the
greatest impact, and (2) are able to service the greatest number of
inhabitants. In deciding on sites/locations and service-mixes, the focus
should be on serving (1) the youth, and (2) those inhabitants who will
elect to retire in rural areas, and who will soend significant amounts of
money during their working lives on building and/or maintaining their
retirement homes.

3.5 Natural Resource Limitations, a Move Away
from Ecosystem Destruction, Pollution and a
National Water Security Crisis

Over the last few years, the majority of ordinary South Africans citizens
were rudely awakened to the reality that South Africa is a water-scarce
country, and not one merely struck or frustrated by occasional droughts.
While we have for many years been able to transfer water between
catchments with a surplus to areas with a deficit, and maintained the
myth of water-abundance, the reality is that the model has run its course
and that we no longer have sufficient water left in the system to
redistribute if we continue to use water as we did in the past. We will have
to employ technology to (1) supplement our water supply, (2) reduce our
use, and (3) better manage and distribute piped water.

Should we, however, choose to continue along the economic trajectory
that disregards our natural base, and continues to incur huge damage
to our natural resources, we will in the very near future become even
more aware of, and be confronted with the following realities: (1)
dwindling water security and availability, wetland destruction, severely
disrupted water catchments and over-utilised and polluted groundwater
sources, especially in our mining and commercial agricultural
productions areas; (2) highly contaminated and toxic waterbodies and

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

waterways; (3) toxic levels of air pollution through highly noxious industrial
activities and the generation of energy through coal-fired power stations;
4) the loss of the very small extent of high-value agricultural land we
once hadi; (5) irreparably damaged ecosystems and loss of the services
hey provide for all forms of life; and (6) a long and rapidly growing list of
extinct species. Furthermore, we will be confronted with the reality that
our continued pollution of rivers and streams, soil, air and the oceans
around us, is not compatible with our plans to (1) grow our tourism sector,
2) expand our agricultural and agro-processing activities, and (3) make
ar greater use of the oceans economy. As a country, we will be asked
o make hard choices, such as between (1) an environment that sustains
us and is not harmful to our lives, and (2) the economic activities and
national income that comes from exporting and burning dirty carbons,
ike coal, and irresponsible, callous and wasteful resource use.

urning away from this looming ecological disaster will require that trade-
offs be made at the national level between (1) noxious and polluting
economic activities, and (2) ecosystem health and integrity. At the same
ime, water demand management, and the behavioural changes and
enforcement protocols that emanate from this, will need to be
introduced, policed and enforced at municipal level. Irreplaceable
natural resources of national significance, irrespective of where they are
located, will need to be acknowledged, demarcated and treated as
such, so that they can contribute to the well-being of all citizens.
Municipalities will have to focus far more so in their land use
management functions on protecting such areas, and promote
compatible and productive uses that contribute to environmental
management and restoration goals.

 

Likewise, sustainable land development and intergenerational spatial
justice will require effective land administration and management, civil
society custodianship and strong and efficient governance. This will only
be possible if (1) municipal land use management systems are in place,

54
 and (2) municipalities are staffed with competent, dedicated and caring
town planning officials and councillors, who cannot be corrupted and
who have the will and mandate to act. In addition to this, rehabilitation
of degraded land in stressed and degraded catchments (including
former mining areas) will need to be done. Mining companies must be
held accountable to clean up what they polluted, and regulations in this
regard rigorously enforced. Mediation of the fall-out in terms of jobs tied
to polluting mining and industrial activities that are distractive of the
ecosystem will have to be done, and job creation in ecologically less-
damaging sectors (1) planned for well in advance of mine closures, and
(2) actively and adequately provided for.

3.6 Climate Change Implications, Regional
Adaptation and Mitigation

Climate change is set to have far-reaching impacts on our country,
notably with regards to temperature and rainfall patterns. Temperatures
are set to increase by between | and 4 degrees Celsius between now
and 2050, in primarily the western and north-western parts of the country,
while the number of very warm days is set to increase in an equally wide
band across the country. Rainfall is set to decrease in a large stretch of
the south-western, western and north-western parts of the country, while
rainfall is set to increase, but also become more erratic in the central and
south-eastern part of the country. These climatic changes will not only
have severely detrimental impacts on the highly productive agricultural
activities in the western and north-western parts of the country. The towns
in these areas, of which most rely heavily on these agricultural
economies, will be equally hard-hit, and their residents required to make
far less use of water for domestic and economic consumption to keep
the agricultural activities going.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

Climate change impacts will also render significant parts of the country
increasingly hostile to human, animal and plant life, and hard to live in. In
addition to this, the likelinood of more veldfires is set to increase,
especially so in vast and remote rural areas where municipal services are
already thinly spread, and the State’s capacity to deal with such disasters
is generally weak. While some of the central and eastern parts of the
country may experience more rain, the equally greater degree of
uncertainty and intensity of the precipitation will not be conducive to
traditional conventional agriculture. Sudden downpours may lead to (1)
a greater loss of top soil, and silting Up of dams and water canals, and
(2) the destruction of rural roads and infrastructure. In urban areas, such
sudden and severe downpours could lead to flash-flooding, loss of life
and destruction of municipal infrastructure, buildings and property,
especially so in cases where these are not well-maintained. In many of
our urban areas, it is especially the poor, vulnerable and marginalised
inhabitants who live in poor housing that is not well-located, and who are
generally not insured, that will disoroportionally suffer the impacts of such
disasters.

In terms of national land use and settlement patterns, climate change
begs serious questions with regards to future human settlement in
national space, such as: How will climatic change impact regional
development patterns in terms of temperature, liveability, water, food
security and the adaptation to viable agricultural practices and
commodities? What kind of impacts can be expected in settlements and
where should new cities be built, and with what population-size in mind?
What are the disaster-risk reduction interventions, coping-capacity and
national resource implications, e.g. drought relief, that are required in
areas that are set to experience significant and intolerable changes in
climate: Should high-risk settlement development for instance be
curbed, will government be able to provide support for the most
vulnerable and if so, of what kind and at what cost? Furthermore, what
kind of activities and settlement patterns should be allowed in such

55
 areas, and should new settlement development in these areas be
discouraged, or concentrated in alternative, carefully selected suitable
locations? Questions around regional adaptation includes consideration
whether directing or discouraging urban and settlement in certain
regions is constitutional, and if so, what kind of method or measure to
regulate settlement in such areas would be used?

The higher levels of discomfort in the interior of the western and north-
western parts of the country may also trigger migration from these parts
to areas with better climates, notably the (1) eastern interior and (2)
eastern and southern coastal belts. The eastern coastal belt and eastern
escarpment is, however, the part of the country (1) most suitable for food
production and surface water-capture, and (2) in which traditional land
tenure systems currently prevail. These are also areas in which the
dreaded land-related legislation of the colonial and Apartheid eras have
left deep scars, both on the people, and space, in the form of limited
access to land, over-grazing and erosion. Given the urgency of the
matter from a national perspective, and the challenges that will be
encountered, it is of crucial importance that ‘a national spatial climate-
mitigation plan’ be prepared, with (1) participation of all role-players
involved, and (2) strong spatial planning, ecosystems and land-use
management components.

In addition to this, climate change is also set to have severely negative
impacts in terms of temperature increases and lower rainfall figures in
countries to the north of South Africa, and up into central Africa. These
changes could potentially lead to large-scale in-migration of
‘environmental refugees’ from such countries to amongst others, South
Africa. Thus, South Africa will both (1) need to be prepared, and (2) our
national space be planned with such eventualities in mind, to avoid the
kind of antagonism and open hostility that refugees from Africa, the
Middle East and Asia are increasingly experiencing in parts of Europe.

 3.7. Land Reform

Irrespective of the final wording of the amendment to Section 25 of the
Constitution specifying the conditions in terms of which the State may
expropriate land without compensation, land reform will see a rapid
expansion from its current form and its performance to date, both in
urban and rural South Africa. In accordance with the intention to address
colonial land and livelihood dispossession and injustice, Black South
Africans will either get (1) secure fenure and land use rights, or (2) full tifle
to land, and the grossly unbalanced land ownership profile, by which the
bulk of commercial agricultural land in the country is held by White South
Africans, will be radically reversed. As such, land reform is set to have a
huge impact on (1) national land-use and land-ownership patterns, (2)
national settlement development, and (3) the national space economy.

In urban areas, land reform is sure to involve the identification of ‘suitable
land for making a life, and quality urban life and living’, i.e. land that
could (1) ensure infill development, (2) bring about greater social and
economic inclusion, (3) unleash new economic opportunities, and (4)
enable a far greater segment of the South African population to own
and lease property, and have access to the amenities and qualities of
urban living. In addition to this, the provision of land for economic
activities and property development in urban areas to Black South
Africans previously excluded from such opportunities, will also assist in
bringing far more new and emerging actors into the economy, and assist
in breaking the back of the deeply monopolistic, concentrated and elite-
controlled nature of the South African economy. At the same time, urban
land reform may assist in making available sites for (1) unleashing new
opportunities in under-valued economies in our urban areas, such as the
optimisation of the cultural industries, entertainment, food preparation,
and service and small-scale manufacturing and repair activities, and (2)
facilitating the functional integration of urban South Africa into a
functional national economic innovation, inclusion and transformation

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

system. This will, however, require of municipalities to gather the
necessary information and keep up-to-date records of all land parcels in
their areas of jurisdiction that are (1) strategically located with regards to
urban economies, (2) underutilised, (3) vacant, and/or (4) kept for
speculative purposes only. It would also require decisive action and the
limiting of time-lags between land acquisition, release, development and
Utilisation.

In rural areas, information such as (1) land ownership, (2) the condition of
the land and soils, (3) the carrying capacity of the land, (4) the availability
of water on the land, (5) accessibility, (6) the quality of fences and roads,
and (7) anticipated exposure to climate change, would be important
considerations. As in urban areas, limiting the time lag between land
acquisition and utilisation will be of the essence. Care would also need
to be taken to mediate the impacts of changes in rural economies,
notably in small towns built up on the back of, and reliant on (1) large-
scale commercial agriculture and large farmers, and (2) their related
market, financial and personal services, daily supplies, education, health
care and fertilizer needs. At the same time, engagement will need to
take place on the matter of tenure in communal land-areas, and the
Utilisation and sharing of such land in the ‘ecological sweet spot’ of our
country, i.e. the eastern coastal belt and eastern escarpment, for food
production, surface water capture and provision of key ecosystem
services.

3.8 Dependency on Natural Resource Extraction
and Related Economic Activities

Currently, our national economy is heavily natural resource-extraction
based, with mining and coal-based energy generation key contributors
to our national GVA. The NDP supports a move away from coal-based
energy generation in line with international trends and climate protocols.
Long-term spatial and infrastructure planning must be cognisant of this

65
 move, and a collectively and carefully planned, well-communicated
and stakeholder-sensitive transition - including the social, spatial and
economic mitigation of the sure-to-be-significant impacts of the move —
be undertaken.

While currently still of enormous importance, mining is set to shrink in terms
of its contribution to the national economy, and undergo a radical
change in terms of employment levels in the light of automation and
possible disruptions in the demand for certain commodities, such as coal
and platinum. The move away from platinum is tied to (1) an increased
search for and use of cheaper alternatives, (2) far more recycling of the
metal, and (3) most importantly, the global move away from diesel cars,
of which most use platinum in their catalytic converters. While (1) the use
of palladium — another member of the Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) —
in the catalytic converters of petrol cars (following on from the turn away
from diesel) may offer some short-term respite, and (2) the use of
platinum in the hydrogen fuel cell-industry may hold out some longer-
term hope, there is a very real likelinood of the PGMs industry seeing
serious shrinkage in the not too distant future. Should this happen, it would
hit our economy very hard in at least three ways: (1) a much smaller
demand for platinum, which could lead to en masse platinum mine
closures and job losses; (2) a greatly reduced demand for diesel-
powered vehicles, which could hurt our local car manufacturing industry
(with its strong emphasis on diesel cars) severely; and (3) a greater
demand for electric cars in which we have not invested as a country,
coupled with a focus in new mining exploration-activities on metals
required for electrical cars, which we are not world-leaders in.

Areas where the coal and platinum mining sectors form the backbone of
the local economy, especially insofar as local employment is concerned,
will have to be supported to transition towards more diversified,
sustainable economies. In places where (1) climate change, and (2) the
lack of, or limited number of opportunities mean that there are no viable

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

economic alternatives to mining, resettlement to places with viable,
sustainable economies will need to be (1) planned for with the full
participation of all stakeholders, and (2) effected with the utmost degree
of circumspection.

3.9 Technology, Innovation, Resilience and
Disruptions in the Space Economy

While this is a fertile field for speculation, there is far less clarity as to what
this shaper will entail and how it will play out in countries, cities and rural
areas throughout the world. What is increasingly clear is that (1)
communication will become faster, more affordable and more
accessible to all; (2) urban areas, notably large urban areas, with their
potential for human-to-human service-based economies, dense
institutional networks and higher education, innovation and research
centres and institutes, will remain, and become even more significant
players in this/the new economy; (3) automation, robotics, and machine
learning is upon us, and will cause major disruptions in the world of work
and will leave very few occupations unaffected, with some areas of
work, such as dangerous and physically draining work in the mining
industry at least being a thing of the past; and (4) those who have higher
levels of education are more likely to manage, utilise and gain from the
transitions than those with only rudimentary levels.

With regards to national spatial development, South Africa should see (1)
the roll-out of lightning-fast broadband access throughout the country
within less than a decade, (2) the advent of highly automated mining
activities with far fewer on-site jobs, which can be sustained by “fly-in-fly-
out” modes of operation, and hence not require the establishment of
‘mining towns’ as in the past, (3) automation in economic sectors that
are currently regarded as major creators of employment, such as
manufacturing and agriculture, thus leading to a reduction in

66
 employment and job creation in areas where it would be sorely needed,
notably rural South Africa, and (4) closures of factories and mines in South
Africa that are unable to compete globally, leading not only to job losses
in towns dependent on those sectors, but also a general contraction in
retail and economic activities in affected municipalities.

In order to ensure that the country is not left behind, the following are
imperative: (1) the roll-out of broadband throughout the country, first to
the most densely populated areas, and thereafter the more sparsely
populated areas; (2) the prioritisation of well-functioning, key national
road and rail networks to ensure the creation of a densely integrated
functional national economic system; (3) a focus on innovation and
knowledge generation, codification, packaging and sale; (4) the
expansion, modernisation and re-gearing of the higher education sector
towards growing and supporting innovation and the entertainment,
cultural and creative industries; and (5) the nurturing of all South Africans,
but especially our youth, by ensuring proper nutrition, a safe, secure and
pollution-free environment, quality health care and meaningful. life-long
learning, to ensure that they are, and remain fully prepared for the
dynamic world they will be living in. In addition to that, if well-used, the
new technologies, given their (1) ease of access, and (2) disruptive
qualities, should be of assistance in breaking down the monopolistic
nature of the South African economy.

For urban areas to play the role that they can and must, ‘public city
space’ will have to be optimised in terms of its ability to attract and grow
informal activities linked to information, communication and technology
services. This will in itself ask (1) less of a focus in urban economic and
spatial development plans on large-scale ‘nodal developments’ with
flashy high-rental shopping malls and office blocks, and warehouses filled
with imported goods, and (2) more on new technology-assisted and
enabled, small-and-medium-sized eco-agro-industries, manufacturing
and cultural activities, and innovation. Should South Africa not succeed

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

in surviving the disruptions and transitions coming our way, it will most
likely lead to (1) the creation of new inequalities, (2) further
fragmentation, and (3) more and deeper gaps between the rich and the
poor, followed by more crime and even more barricaded property
developments.

 3.10 Globalisation, Supra-National Regionalisation,
Gateway Nodes and National Connectivity
and Integration

Despite the current setbacks for global trade, the long-term trend will be
for (1) increased global trade, and (2) increasing integration of countries
and cities in the global economy. The importance of being part of this
global economy and to be ‘an equal partner’ in this system, will demand
of countries, including South Africa, to ensure ease of access to their
economies through well-functioning (1) global gateways, i.e. harbours,
airports and border posts, and (2) a well-maintained national road and
rail network. The latter will also ensure that the whole country, and not
only parts of it become and remain part of this global economy.
Prioritisation of routes on this network will be very important, as funds for
road and rail connections will be severely limited. Where possible, rail
should be prioritised, to (1) reduce carbon emissions and damage to
roads by trucks, and (2) minimise the social costs that communities in
towns with truck stops, especially their most vulnerable members, often
suffer.

Significant changes are also envisaged in the top order of the global
economy, with (1) China and India set to greatly strengthen their
positions, and (2) regional powerhouses, such as Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey
and Mexico poised to increasingly make their presence felt. Furthermore,
a number of countries on the African continent are rising rapidly, notably
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Angola. Closer to
home, Mozambique is growing at a steady pace, and Zimbabwe should
be making rapid economic progress in the next few decades. Should
South Africa wish to remain a part of this global economy, it will need to
ensure that its urban and rural-based economies are globally
competitive, which would amongst others, require (1) reducing

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

constrains on small business development, and (2) the upskilling of our
labour force. From a national spatial perspective, South Africa must
ensure that it ties its economy into the (1) new global economies, (2)
regional powerhouses, and (3) emerging economies on the African
continent. This must be done though aligning its ports with the growing
significance of new trade routes to the east of the country, and ensuring
fast and reliable connectivity through these ports to not only the
Gauteng urban region, but also other regions in our country with strong
export opportunities.

Of equal importance will be the strengthening of regional trading blocs,
such as the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), to (1) create greater regional consumer markets
and (2) ensure more bargaining power when negotiating the terms of
trade with other such blocs, e.g. the European Union. Alignment of
national freight and logistics infrastructure, especially the (1) major road
and rail corridors, but also (2) harbour infrastructure, will be required to
establish and sustain strong regional linkages within SADC.

Internally, if a fast-growing, well-connected and more inclusive economy
is to be achieved, the development of movement infrastructure and a
variety of modes of transport will have to be guided by a national spatial
development pattern with at its base (1) the pursuit of more compact,
concentrated settlement in fewer core national nodes, to reduce the
number of main roads and railway lines to be built and maintained, (2)
more mixed, higher density development, to reduce the need for
motorised travel and distances to be travelled, and (3) higher levels of
beneficiation and processing of raw materials, to reduce the volume of
raw products that pass through our harbours and require road and rail
transport and expensive infrastructure networks.

The movement network will also have to be strengthened in the eastern
escarpment and eastern and southern coastal areas, to support the

72
 population, economic and climatic shifts described earlier in Section 3.6.
In addition to this, infrastructure maintenance will have to be prioritised,
not only for freight transport, but equally so for the safe, efficient and
affordable movement of passengers, including tourists. In densely settled
urban areas, a special emphasis will need to be placed on the provision
of more affordable public transport services in Transit Oriented
Development-configurations.

3.11 Institutional Weaknesses and Fragmentation
and Prospects for National Developmental
Action

In a country with the dreadful history of exploitation and targeted
underdevelopment like South Africa's, there are high expectations of the
State to assist in (1) correcting the wrongs of the past, (2) healing the still-
open wounds, and (3) creating a different and better future. This is, and
has proven to be a huge endeavour, and one that government has
managed to attend to with different degrees of success. What has not
made this ‘national transformation, reconstruction and redevelopment
task’ any easier is the ‘cutting-up and parcelling-out’ of inherently highly
integrated national reconstruction, transformation and redevelopment
tasks to different soheres of government in terms of the Constitution, with
limited powers of one sphere over another to bring about (or force) the
required nationally-focused and significant alignment, integration and
coordination. In addition to this, the need to bring other spheres of
government on board in planning processes, also has a cost-implication,
requiring of officials to (1) meet and talk through such tasks, and (2) try to
find ways to coordinate, align and harmonize their actions.

 

Given a wide range of reasons, notably (1) the costs involved, (2) the lack
of enforcement of decisions reached in multi-stakeholder engagement
sessions, (3) the different modalities and work and budget-cycles, and (4)

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

the unique particularities of decision-making in the different soheres and
sectors of government, national sector departments have increasingly
focused on fulfilling their mandates and going if alone in their pursuit of
meeting their set targets. In addition to this, inefficiency, incompetence,
corruption and theft of state resources has (1) led to an erosion of trust in
public institutions, (2) severely damaged the culture of service delivery in
the public service, and (3) siphoned off billions of Rands required for
redress and development. The result has been an increasingly frustrated
populace that has lost much of its trust in the State and its capabilities.
Another outcome of State failure has been an increasingly greater
reliance on (1) the private sector and (2) outside countries and entities to
finance much-needed infrastructure investment. While ‘it may get things
done’, it may also lead to (1) the country losing control over its resources,
and (2) an inability to implement plans and frameworks that are in the
national interest, rather than those that are in the interests of the private
investors or foreign countries.

In the provincial sphere, many provincial governments have prepared
provincial economic growth and development plans and spatial
development frameworks to attend to their economic, spatial
development and human settlement challenges, but have in most cases
lacked (1) the funds required to put these plans into motion, given that
the bulk of their funds are tied to the provision of education, health and
welfare services, and (2) struggled to secure national sector department
and municipal buy-in fo and support for these plans and frameworks.

In the local space, municipalities are increasingly struggling to provide
basic municipal services, often overwhelmed by the huge national
redevelopment and transformation tasks they have been given. And,
while the crucial and potentially very powerful (1) spatial planning and
transformation, and (2) land use management functions resort with them,
most municipalities lack the leadership, technical capacity and finances
to adequately execute their mandates. At the same time, many

73
 municipalities have turned ever-more inward, both in terms of municipal
planning and the provision of municipal services, which has been hugely
detrimental to progressive, transformative municipal-wide planning, and
subsequently also provincial and national planning and transformation.
In addition to this, in distressed mining and heavy manufacturing areas,
municipalities were not only hard-hit by job losses and business closures,
but also lost their steady and significant incomes from the sale of water
and electricity to mines and factories. In many rural areas, municipalities
have struggled to prepare credible plans and achieve the desired
developmental impact, given (1) the vast size of their areas of jurisdiction,
(2) a lack of capacity, and (3) the enormity of their inherited service
backlogs.

While the Sfate is and remains crucial to the reconstruction,
transformation and development of our country, it is currently struggling
to do so. Inadequate funding and capacity, and a loss of trust and
legitimacy in the eyes of the people, coupled with a deficit of political
will, are key constraints on this crucial endeavour. Failure to deliver on
much smaller tasks has also reduced confidence in the ability of the State
to attend to the large national transformation questions. As such,
rebuilding trust and showing progress in the areas of transformation will
be crucial in the next decade. Making good on planned interventions
and ensuring feasibility of investments in terms of a long-term plan will also
assist in this regard. To do so within the limited budgets available will
require (1) far more spatial targeting, integration and alignment in
infrastructure investment and development spending by the State, and
(2) ensuring that existing and possible systemic links between places and
communities are optimised. Careful planning of the placing, type and
reach of State facilities will go a long way in assisting such processes.
Equally so will be careful planning of the national spatial development
pattern, to concentrate resources and investment in areas where the
majority of our people are living and are likely to live in future. Such
national, regional and local-scale planning will, however, require (1)

 

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

staffing of government departments and municipalities with well-trained,
ethically-solid professionals; (2) far more direction and clarity in terms of
what is to be done, where, when, for how long, and by whom; and (3)
the introduction of the necessary systems to drive and assess compliance
and ensure accountability.

 3.12 Key National Spatial Development Dynamics,
Challenges and Opportunities

The key national spatial development challenges and opportunities (1)
that emerged from the discussion of the ten National Spatial
Development Shapers and (2) that the NSDF will have to respond to are:

e Providing life chances and a decent quality of life to an
additional 17 to 22 million people between now and 2050, within
the context of (1) an ever-smaller habitable land area due to
climate change, (2) ever-more stressed, threatened and
compromised ecological spaces and systems, and (3) ever-fewer
natural resources;

e Ensuring rapid redress at scale to Black South Africans (1)
dispossessed of their land, (2) systematically excluded from the
economy, and (3) severely restricted and stinted in their life
chances, while at the same time rapidly growing and
transforming the economy and transforming national, provincial
and local space;

e Maintaining national biodiversity and ecosystem integrity for
global, national and local resilience within an environment of a
young, dynamic and aspirational population;

e Managing competition between human activity and nationally
important ecosystems and the essential services they provide,
notably so with regards to water production, energy generation,
mining, manufacturing and food production in the central and
eastern parts of the country;

e Managing surface and groundwater use and potentially harmful
land-uses in surface-water production areas, preventing
contamination of water bodies and sources by human activities,
rehabilitating contaminated water bodies, streams and rivers and
maintaining bulk and local reticulation water infrastructure;

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

Making the shift to a greener, low-carbon, more service-based
economy through (1) compact, mixed land-use well-connected
urban and rural settlement development, (2) the provision of
enabling municipal services, and (3) efficient and affordable ICT
and transport infrastructure investment and development:
Optimising the enormous economic growth and job creation
opportunities that dense, compact and diverse urban
agglomerations and development corridors offer in the areas of
human-to-human service provision, trade, entertainment, and
the creative industries, especially so in an ICT-rich, but also job-
threatening 4'h Industrial Revolution environment;

Improving the quality of life and human capability in a fiscally-
constrained environment through (1) the well-located, planned
and integrated provision of social services, and (2) the
optimisation of the economic and employment benefits of such
service provision in all our cities, towns and villages;

Transforming the current highly financialised commercial farming
agricultural sector into a mixed system, including hundreds of
thousands of small and medium-sized producers, and optimising
the economic dividends from the research, marketing, financing
and equipment development opportunities that this transition will
create in both urban and rural South Africa;

Competing in the global economy through innovative product
and service development in especially our large cosmopolitan
urban regions, with an emphasis on (1) the creative industries,
and (2) the cultural and entertainment sectors, and utilising both
of these to bolster our tourism offering;

Optimising the enormous economic opportunities that SADC
offers for (1) trade, (2) collaborative research and knowledge
development, packaging and distribution, (3) water-sharing, and
(4) energy generation;

80
 Identifying and utilising opportunities for the beneficiation of
minerals, metals and agricultural products where it is
economically viable and ecologically sustainable; and
Optimising our existing national transport infrastructure network
by (1) prioritising rail over road, and (2) investing in and
maintaining the most crucial components of the network, with an
emphasis on connecting global gateways, core urban nodes
and regional development anchors throughout the country.

 PART FOUR: National Spatial Development Vision, Logic, Levers
and Outcomes

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

 
 4.1 Introduction

In this part of the NSDF a number of the core components of the National
Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2) are covered. In the first section, the
National Spatial Development Vision to direct, guide and align spatial
planning, infrastructure investment and development is provided. This is
followed by an exposition of the shifts that need to be made from the
current National Spatial Development Logic to the required Post-
Apartheid National Spatial Development Logic in accordance with the
National Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2). Following this exposition
is an introduction to, and overview of a series of ‘National Spatial
Development Levers’ to bring about the Post-Apartheid National Spatial
Development Pattern in accordance with the Post-Apartheid National
Spatial Development Vision and Logic. This is followed by a section
outlining a series of five National Spatial Development Outcomes that
must and will be accomplished by (1) making the shifts in accordance
with the Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development Logic, and (2)
putting the National Spatial Development Levers to their envisaged use.
These outcomes connect the National Spatial Development Vision and
Logic, as set out in this part of the NSDF (i.e. Part Four) to the desired
National Spatial Development Pattern in Part Five. Following this section is
a vision of what life could be like in South Africa in 2050 should we jointly
(1) work towards the vision, (2) make the necessary shifts in our spatial
development logic, (3) use the levers as envisaged, and (4) pursue the
outcomes, as set out in this part of the NSDF.

4.2. The National Spatial Development Vision
The purpose of the Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development Vision

is to provide a long-term guiding light for realising our desired Post-
Apartheid National Spatial Development Pattern. As set out in the

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

National Transformation Logic (see Section 1.2) and the NSDF’s Theory of
Change (see Section 1.4.3), this vision is:

e Derived and drawn from the National Development Paradigm,
with as its key pillars the Constitution, the NDP, and the full suite of
post-1994 legislation and policy; and

e Prepared within the current and anticipated future challenges
and associated opportunities facing our country (see Part 3 and
specifically Section 3.13).

In addition to the more eternal long-term National Spatial Development
Vision and accompanying Mission-statement (see Figure 29 below), a
time-bound 2050-National Spatial Development Vision is provided in
Section 4.5. This vision serves to make (1) the future more tangible, and
(2) our infrastructure investment and development spending actions
more measurable in terms of moving our country from where it is now to
where we want it to be.

4.3. The National Spatial Development Logic

A key driver in the NSDF’s theory of change (see Section 1.4.3) is the move
from a National Spatial Development Logic based on, and in service of
the colonial and Apartheid National Development Paradigms, to one
based on and in service of a Post-Apartheid National Development
Paradigm. In this regard, it is framed and guided by:

e The NDP targets, strategic levers and strategic policy direction;
and
e The five normative principles, as provided in SPLUMA.

In this section of the framework, (1) the direction and guidance provided

by the NDP and the five SPLUMA principles, and (2) the shifts that have to
be made in the National Spatial Development Logic are set out.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019 84
 The national spatial development implications of the strategic direction
provided by the NDP in the formulation of a new National Spatial
Development Logic can be interpreted as follows:

(a) With regards to Inclusive Growth
A need fo:

e Transit to a compact, service-based, resource-efficient space
economy, that includes both rural and urban spaces, and that
recognises the limitations of our national natural resource base;

e Consider the long-term resilience-benefits of a more compact
settlement footprint in spaces less prone to the impacts of climate
change, and adjust (1) settlement development forms and
patterns, (2) housing types, building materials and construction
methods, and (3) transport and service networks accordingly:

e Increase access and remove barriers to (1) the often
concentrated and barricaded benefits of the national resource
base, and (2) the locational benefits and amenities of exquisite
and exclusive places developed for the few;

e Promote inclusive and sustainable urban settlement growth and
facilitate movement and trade in and between settlements;

e Support growing economic nodes in previously forgotten and
ignored regions, and ensure a more diversified economy;

e Deal with declining mining and industrial areas in compassionate,
smart, affordable and sustainable ways; and

e Recognise and develop settlements in accordance with their (1)
roles in the national space economy and network of settlements,
(2) regional and local contexts/settings, and (3) labour-
absorption capacities.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

(b) With regards to the Capacity of our People
A need fo:

e Ensure access to, and provision of quality services to all South
Africans, to enable the development of human capital
irrespective of where it is located in the country;

e Develop national urban centres of service excellence and
innovation, to drive and maintain the global competitiveness of
our country; and

e Develop differentiated, place-specific and viable responses to
critical issues, such as service gaps, migration hot-spots, high
levels of youth unemployment and exclusion, and land
availability and tenure-related issues.

(c) With regards to a Capable State
A need fo:

e Recognise and use (1) spatial planning as a_ tool for
transformation, and (2) spatial planning processes and plans,
such as SDFs, as opportunities for integrating and coordinating
State action;

e Introduce a new spatial development logic and vision in the
process of building a new, cohesive society; and

e Attend to state capacity gaps, to ensure fulfilment of the NDP’s
developmental agenda.

85
 4.3.2 The SPLUMA Principles as Guide and Driver

In addition to the policy directives provided by the NDP, SPLUMA provides
five guiding principles that have to be used and observed in all spatial
planning processes at all scales, including the national scale. These
principles are the following:

e Spatial justice;

e Spatial sustainability:

e Spatial resilience;

e Spatial efficiency; and
e Good administration.

In terms of the formulation of a new National Spatial Development Logic,
the following guidance and direction is drawn from these principles:

(a) Spatial Justice
A need fo:

e Ensure redress in terms of access to the economic opportunities
and locational benefits that the country and its cities, towns and
rural areas offer, including well-located, productive land;

e Include inclusion of previously excluded areas in the national
space economy; and

e Pursue intergenerational justice in (1) the location and pattern of
settlement development, and (2) the use of natural resources.

(b) Spatial Sustainability

A need fo:

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

e Ensure national spatial development within the limits of the
natural resource base of the country — now and in the future;

e Pursue the development of viable settlements and sustainable
economies; and

e Pursue a more concentrated, well-connected and more
compact national footprint, to increase access to opportunities
for all, and reduce (1) use and wastage of natural resources and
State finances, and (2) the need for motorised transport.

(c) Spatial Resilience
A need fo:

« Proactively minimise risks to settlements though the considered
selection of the location and pattern of settlement development;
and

e Develop settlements in ways that reduce their dependency on
carbon-based fuels and grid-based energy-distribution systems,
as and where possible, to mitigate and reduce their climatic
impact.

(d) Efficiency
A need fo:
e Optimise the use of all State and non-State resources, and
minimise the negative impacts of settlement development,
wherever it is done and whatever spatial form it takes; and

« Diversify and densify settlements to reduce transactional costs
and the need for motorised transport.

(e) Good Administration

86
 A need fo:

Pursue coordination, integration and spatial alignment in all forms
of government spatial planning, budgeting and investment;
Ensure maximum participation and active engagement in spatial
planning and settlement building, grow the local economy and
tax base, and build social cohesion; and

Ensure adherence to the law, notably SDFs and municipal Land
Use Schemes (LUSs), to ensure that the social, spatial and
economic benefits of good spatial planning materialise.

4.3.3 The Necessary ‘Shifts’

Based on the NDP and SPLUMA as guides and drivers, the following
interrelated shifts in the National Spatial Development Logic are
proposed by the NSDF to ensure the movement to a truly Post-Apartheid
National Spatial Development Pattern:

 

(a) With regards to the beneficiaries of national spatial planning and
spatial development

Placing the interests and benefit of the many at centre stage,
and not those of a/the few;

Ensuring access for all to the use of land for residential, social,
economic and cultural purposes, both in urban and rural areas;

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

Limiting the development of luxury enclaves and estates for the
use and enjoyment of the few; and

Ensuring rapid release of land through well-planned urban and
rural land reform at scale, for the use, development and
enjoyment by the many.

(b) With regards to our natural resource base

Placing a much greater focus on, creating a much greater
awareness of, and introducing a far greater quantification of our
natural resource base, to enable and enhance the sustainable
use and protection of critical natural resources;

Making a clearer distinction between the ecological and
economic value of natural resources and pursuing a far greater
interest in and understanding of future trends and risks in natural
resource use;

Identifying and earmarking broad categories of (1) high-value
agricultural land for national food security and agrarian reform,
and (2) environmentally-significant areas for the provision and use
of essential ecosystem services.

87
  

(c) With regards to the nature, function and performance of our
settlements

Recognising our settlements as ‘our new gold’, and establishing a
new, renewable people and place-based economy based on
human interaction and ingenuity in quality urban spaces, and no
longer a finite, ecologically-unfriendly mineral and metals
resource-extraction driven economic model;

Reframing the old logic of cities as ‘engines of growth’ in service
of capital, to ‘cities as engines of radical transformation in service
of inclusive, people-focused, people-driven development and
transformation’, and unleashing the enormous opportunities they
offer for (1) the human-to-human services sector, (2) the
innovation, knowledge-creation, valorisation and sharing sector,
(3) the culture, entertainment and restaurant sector, and (4) the
domestic and international tourism sector;

Optimising the dividend of the millions of young South Africans
that will be entering higher education, and be (1) gaining new
insights, (2) ‘making new sense’ of the world, and (3) developing
new forms of knowledge:

Recognising cities as democratic spaces in which millions of
economic activities and transactions take place and can take
place, and in doing so, have the power to disrupt and destroy the
highly concentrated, monopolistic nature of our economy;

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

Emphasising the need to develop a new kind of city in which
public space can become a key driver of a new ‘people’s
economy from below’;

Pursuing a denser, smaller, polycentric system of settlements that
has (1) a smaller footprint, and (2) spans urban and rural areas;
Making a clear distinction between the roles and capacity of
different types of settlement on the national settlement network;
and

Recognising the need for the future-proofing of cities as sites of
human innovation in becoming active participants in, and not
victims of the era of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and the 4" Industrial
Revolution.

e 2

oo *@ 9

   
 

 

(d) With regards to our rural areas

Recognising the need to develop and strengthen regional-rural
systems in the pursuit of vibrant, inclusive and sustainable rural
development;

Pursuing the identification, development and strengthening of
‘regional development anchors’ in rural areas, to (1) connect
urban to rural areas in mutually-beneficial ways, and (2) act as
catalysts for regional-rural development;

Developing a systems-based ‘polycentric rural service-delivery
network’ around regional developments anchors and carefully
selected ‘rural service towns’, to provide quality public services,
and ensure far greater levels of rural-to-rural interaction and local
economic development;

88
 e Exploring the delineation of ‘rural edges’ in rural areas to ensure
the protection of (1) the unique, intrinsic qualities of our rural
areas, (2) the cultural, customary and historical value they have,
and (3) the often highly sensitive ecosystems they harbour;

e Pursuing intra-rural trade as core systemic and_ social
glue/cohesion-activity between villages and towns in rural areas,
and not shopping malls, which at core are little more than ‘one-
sided-extraction transaction points’; and

e Pursuing greater resilience of rural areas through diversification, in
so doing ensuring that they are not and do not become ‘single-
economic sector’ places.

(e) With regards to the nature, significance, form and impact of spatial
development planning

e Ensuring greater coordination, integration and collaboration in
spatial development planning, both in and between the spheres
and sectors of government, including the use of (1) national
spatial targeting and (2) differentiated responses to the potentials
and challenges of designated sub-national intervention areas;

e Investing at scale in areas identified for future economic growth,
for the necessary period of time to make an impact, and with the
benefit of not only the national economy, but also the regional
and local economies in mind;

e Placing a far greater focus on the developmental impact of
national investment and spending initiatives on (1) sub-national
regions and (2) the livelinoods and well-being of communities in
such regions;

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

e — Introducing a ‘spatial transformation accountability system’ to set
spatially-focused targets, and drive and measure progress with
regards to (1) targeted investment in national priority spaces, (2)
spatial transformation, and (3) the wise utilisation of our natural
resource base; and

e Driving far greater involvement in, and support by sector
departments and provinces in municipal spatial development
planning, to ensure (1) the preparation and use of progressive,
quality municipal SDFs, and (2) the enforcement of land-use
policies and rules emanating from such SDFs in municipal Land
Use Management Systems (LUMSs), as provided for in SPLUMA.

4.4 National Spatial Development Levers

In order to (1) give spatial expression to the National Spatial Development
Vision, and (2) support the shifts that need to be made in accordance
with the new National Spatial Development Logic, a series of ‘National
Spatial Development Levers’ were developed. These levers have their
home in:

e The contextual realities, challenges and opportunities, as set out
in Part Three;

e The drivers, levers and principles as set out in the NDP, the IUDF
and SPLUMA (see Sections 1.3.2 and 4.3);

« What is considered ‘good spatial and settlement planning’ in
local and international planning policy frameworks, guidelines
and practice; and

e The theoretical domains of spatial development planning, urban
design, regional and rural development planning, institutional
economics, agglomeration economics, and ecological resource
planning and management.

89
 Six such National Spatial Development Levers were developed. Each of
these is discussed below (see Figures 31 and 32).

 4.4.1 Urban Areas and Regions as Engines of
National Transformation, Innovation and
Inclusive Economic Growth

The IUDF argues that, “... in the
4 economic history of humanity,
= urbanisation has always been an

accelerator of growth and
development, bringing about
enormous changes in the spatial
distribution of people and resources,
and in the use and consumption of
land”. With nearly 70% of South
African’s population already living in
cities and towns, and this figure set to rise to 80% by 2050, the NSDF shares
this view, and argues that urban areas will play an increasingly important
role in the development of a shared and sustainable South Africa. Urban
areas will replace commodities as South Africa's ‘new gold’. The NSDF
does, however, hold that urban areas will only be able to perform this
critical and desired role if:

#9

e There are high levels of inter-connectivity between the country’s
city regions, cities and towns, and they are all tightly integrated
into a mutually beneficial and resilient national urban settlement
network (see also Section 4.4.6 below);

e The benefits of agglomeration in urban areas are allowed to
surface and flourish through (1) fast-tracked urban land reform
and land release, (2) effective settlement planning, design and
management, including growth management, (3) the
introduction of regulations and land use management systems
that focus on strategic and not petty matters, (4) densification,

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

diversification and quality public place-making, (5) the provision
of basic municipal and social services in a financially viable way,
(6) the provision and use of effective public transport and non-
motorised bicycle lanes and walkways, (7) stringent water
demand and waste management, (8) the creation of safer
environments, and (9) the provision of effective policing services;
and

« Regional-level urban development corridors between (1) cities
and towns in urban regions, as well as (2) existing and emerging
nodes within cities and towns (such as between township nodes,
suburban nodes and Central Business Districts) are planned,
developed, supported and strengthened.

4.4.2 National Spatial Development Corridors as
Incubators and Drivers of New Economies and
Quality Human Settlements

National Spatial Development
Corridors are large stretches of

9

>
densely-populated human
ib a settlements and intense
economic activity along/on
roads and/or railway lines. The
dense human settlements, the road/railway links and the intensive
economic activities mutually support each other in a synergistic way.
While such corridors often develop organically over long periods of time,
they can be supported and strengthened, and their development fast-
tracked though well-considered and targeted State interventions.
Interventions of this nature typically entail (1) the strengthening of the
economy or the housing market in cities and towns in the corridor, (2) the
construction of new, or the expansion and/or upgrading of existing road

93
 and railway links in the corridor and/or (3) the provision of targeted
incentives to support denser, more concentrated development in
corridors with more sprawling settlement patterns.

The NSDF regards National Spatial Development Corridors as potentially
powerful national spatial development levers, especially (1) along
coastal-based tourist routes, and (2) in former Bantustan areas marked
by dense, yet sprawling human settlements along roads and/or railway
lines.

The development of such mega-scale National Spatial Development
Corridors will, however, require:

e Intensive and _— sustained broad-based, multi-sectoral
intergovernmental and SOE-collaboration, especially so with
regards to the quantum, timing and spatial location of (1) land
to be released for use/settlement, (2) infrastructure investment,
upgrading and maintenance, (3) and social service provision;

« The development of urban areas in the corridor in accordance
with the requirements for urban areas as set out in Section 4.4.1
above; and

e The availability of viable, real economic opportunities, which
would ideally not be based on a single economic sector, to (1)
enhance resilience, and (2) increase the prospect of developing
robust and diverse economies based on these opportunities.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

4.4.3 Productive Rural Regions as Drivers of
National Rural Transitions and Cornerstones of
our National Resource Foundation

Rural areas, especially in the former
Bantustans, (1) were zones of
extreme neglect, and at the
receiving end of the worst excesses
of large-scale commercial farming,
mining activities and urban-based
manufacturing economies during
colonial and Apartheid times, and
(2) have of late been the sites of
often well-intended, but piece-
meal, unintegrated and fragmented spatial and economic
development initiatives.

 

The NSDF puts forward a Regional-Rural Development Model (see Figure
33) as a third National Spatial Development Lever. This model:

* Takes a systemic view of rural areas, and proposes the ‘soft
delineation’ of ‘polycentric functional rural regions’ that have (1)
at least one well-connected regional development anchor,
both within the region on the national transport network to
‘anchor’ the region in the national space economy, (2) social,
cultural, historical, economic and cultural characteristics and
attributes that would make the development of a ‘functional
rural region’ possible over time, and (3) the potential for infra-
regional trade between towns and villages in the region;

« Proposes the preparation of regional-rural development plans,
as the DRDLR has already begun to do in rural South Africa, for
these regions, and include the projects and plans that are

94
 identified in these plans in the IDPs and SDFs of the municipalities
in whose areas of jurisdiction the regions fall;

e Requires that land reform be fast-tracked and undertaken within
the framework of the regional-rural development plan, to ensure
that suitable and well-located (1) agricultural land, and (2)
stands in towns, are sought and released for productive
purposes, and that the necessary support for beneficiaries
(inputs, fencing, equipment, markets, finances, etc.) is properly
planned for and undertaken in a systematic, structured and
effective way;

e Requires wise natural resource use, management and
protection;

e  Utilises the Social Service Provisioning Model (see Section 4.4.4
and Figure 34) to (1) provide social services in villages, towns and
regional development anchors in accordance with their role
and place in the rural region, in the most effective, sustainable
and affordable way, and (2) create at least one regional
development anchor/town to attract and retain professionals
and entrepreneurs who would otherwise generally not move to,
or stay in rural areas;

e Envisages the use of ‘rural edges’ (see Glossary of Terms) to
protect the rural regions from intrusion of non-compatible and
destructive land uses that could (1) disrupt or violate the rural
integrity of the region, (2) compromise ecosystems on which the
region relies, and (3) threaten local lifestyles and cultures in the
region; and

e Depends on local people being duly empowered to become
active participants in the development of their areas, and
hence makes a move away in rural development thinking and
practice from an approach of ‘transformation-from-above’ to
one of ‘transformation-from-below’vii,

 4.4.4 A National Spatial Social Service Provisioning
Model to Ensure Effective, Affordable and
Equitable Social Service Delivery

on The realities of (1) national fiscal
a constraints, (2) the high construction,
9 9 maintenance and staffing costs of
social services, and the (3) general

Ee inward focus in requests and

( < y proposals in municipal IDPs and SDFs

for the placing of national and

7 : provincial social service facilities,

require that a rational allocation of

facilities rendering social services be done in national space. In addition

to this, investment in social infrastructure, if (1) planned well, (2) designed

for multiple uses, and (3) placed in ‘the right location/spot’, e.g. on public

transport routes, and in a place where adequate municipal services are
available, in a village, town or city, can become:

 

e An attractor for economic activities and contribute to place-
making, urban densification and diversification; and

e Acatalyst for nodal development, and assist in reducing transport
costs and limiting urban and rural sprawl.

The provision of social services is also a creator of public sector jobs with
secure incomes, which can assist in bringing a degree of predictability to
the frequency and size of disposable income in a region or town. In rural
areas, where settlement development was often not planned, the
preparation of a proper ‘rural design framework/plan’ and the placing
of government services in accordance with this framework/plan, could
greatly assist in developing rural towns/settlements with solid, resilient
public investment/capital structures.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

The National Spatial Social Service Provisioning Model (see Figure 33) put
forward in the NSDF as a National Spatial Development Lever, works on a
hierarchical base, with the highest order services with the largest spatial
reach in each category (see Figure 34), being placed in the highest order
places In for instance the case of health care, regional hospitals would
be placed in ‘national urban cores’ and ‘regional development
anchors’, and mobile clinics in small villages. Likewise, universities would
be located in ‘national urban cores’, high schools in ‘rural service
centres’, and small schools and mobile libraries in villages.

While rather rigid in appearance, the model does not propose an iron-
caged spatial investment model, but instead envisages a situation by
which municipalities and national and provincial sector departments
would use the ‘national and regional settlement and service network’ or
‘social service wheel’ for short, as strong indicator and guide in jointly
engaging and deciding on the spatial allocation of facilities across
space. In addition to this, the wheel could also be used to:

e Avoid and resolve intergovernmental disputes regarding the
spatial location of social service facilities;

e Inform, structure and guide engagements by communities with
government regarding the provisioning and spatial location of
social services; and

e Engage and ‘interrogate’ spatial investment decisions by
national and provincial sector departments and municipalities
regarding social services in accordance with the NSDF’s
envisaged ‘national spatial accountability model’ (see Parts 5
and 6 of the NSDF).

 4.4.5 A National Ecological Infrastructure System to
Ensure a Shared, Resilient and Sustainable
National Natural Resource Foundation

It is both a (1) national spatial
development and (2) human rights
imperative to ensure sustainable
and just access to natural
resources for current and future
generations. The National Spatial
Development Vision recognises
this, and specifically refers to the
need for our country’s natural
resources to be shared and used by all in a sustainable manner. In order
to give spatial expression to this imperative, the NSDF puts forward the
introduction of a National Spatial Ecological Infrastructure System as a
national spatial development lever in recognition of:

 

e The limited availability of high-value agricultural land, and seeks
to ensure that this resource is identified and managed with the
utmost of care to ensure national food security;

e The high levels of regional interdependency between water
catchment areas and the enormous volumes of water transfers
in the country, and hence the need to protect (1) surface water

The National Spatial Development Lever put forward in the NSDF in this
regard seeks to (1) identify those areas of crucial national ecological

the high costs associated with the construction, upgrading and
maintenance of such networks, which include airports, harbours, border
posts, logistic hubs, electricity, fiber networks, broadband, natural gas
pipelines, and road and rail networks, and (2) the need to recover such
costs through use, a country has to carefully plan where these networks
are to be built/installed. In the case of South Africa, the legacy of historic
national development paradigms in terms of which such networks
supported first colonial extraction and export, and later the creation of
the Apartheid State for a White minority, requires that these networks be

The National Spatial Development Lever put forward in the NSDF with
regards to transport and communications infrastructure networks, seeks
to ensure:

e Investment in maintaining, strengthening and expanding
conneciivity, to ensure the creation of a solid transport and
communications network between urban areas, regional
development anchors and smaller towns and villages in such
regions, with a focus on (1) ensuring the roll-out and continuous
upgrading of broadband access to all South Africans, and (2)
prioritising rail over road infrastructure;

e More people-focused infrastructure investment, such as (1)
upgrading infrastructure networks in major urban areas and
towns, to accommodate far higher densities and intensities, (2)
installing and maintaining infrastructure networks in former
township areas at scale, so as to develop these previously
neglected areas into high-quality urban living spaces, and (3)
developing quality public spaces, pedestrian walkways and
efficient, affordable and safe public transport networks for use by
all;

e More upgrading of ageing urban municipal service infrastructure
and large-scale investment of municipal infrastructure in regional
development anchors and rural service towns; and

e More investment in the enabling and catalytic infrastructure
required for (1) renewable energy generation, storage and
distribution, (2) smallholder farming and agro-processing, (3)
tourism, culture and entertainment-led economic growth, and (4)
innovation and knowledge-creation, packaging and transfer.

4.5 National Spatial Development Outcomes

4.5.1 Introduction

This section outlines a series of five National Spatial Development
Outcomes that mus? and will be accomplished by (1) making the shifts as
set out Section 4.3, and (2) using the National Spatial Development Levers
as set out Section 4.4. These outcomes, each of which is briefly described
in the following five sections, connect the National Spatial Development
Vision and Logic in this part of the NSDF (Part Four) to the desired Post-
Apartheid National Spatial Development Pattern as set out in Part Five.

e 4.5.2

a A network of consolidated, transformed and well-
©) connected national urban nodes, regional
development anchors, and development corridors that
enable South Africa to derive maximum transformative benefit from
urbanisation, urban living and inclusive economic development.

National Spatial Outcome One

In terms of this outcome:

e« Consolidated and quality settlements are provided with the
necessary social and economic infrastructure for a fast-growing
population in a way that considers (1) all our available natural
and man-made resources, and enabling and empowering
technologies, and (2) the need to provide for both current and
future generations;

e National urban regions and nodes act as national and global
gateways for trade, tourism and national political functions, and
gateways for African and regional integration;

e High-density urban nodes provide opportunities for interaction,
innovation and enterprise development within existing, as well as
new, inclusive and interaction centred enterprise economies;

A well-developed service infrastructure system acts as basis for
last access to high quality social and other services in:
A strong and well-functioning polycentric system of well-
connected urban core areas within wider functional urban
regions and corridors that offer a wide range of high-order
medical, education, government, safety and security, trade-
gateway and economic services is put in place; and
A network of vibrant regional development anchor towns,
with strong rural-rural connections to strategically located
rural service towns that act as regional-rural service providers,
is created.

4.5.3 National Spatial Outcome Two

fae National corridors of opportunity enable sustainable

and transformative national development,

urbanisation, urban consolidation, mutually beneficial urban and rural
linkages, and ecological management.

In terms of this outcome:

Economic growth, consolidated settlement development and
trade infrastructure and trade are located within well-connected
inter-regional and national development corridors and routes;
Urbanisation, settlement growth and the dynamically changing
needs of a growing population are directed, attracted to, and
accommodated in a system of national urban regions and
nodes, with specific emphasis on national-scale transformation
and development corridors that provide opportunities for
regional adaptation through:

Settlement transformation and consolidation and inclusive

urban economies;

National connectivity and movement infrastructure
systems are strategically located, extended and maintained, to support
a diverse, adaptive and inclusive space economy and a set key national
and regional gateway cities and towns.

In terms of this outcome:

e The national transport, trade and communication network is
aligned with, and serves the identified nodes and development
corridors in a way that supports the development needs of our
growing population though (1) effective support for the
economy, (2) the delivery of quality services, and (3) growth in
employment;

e All national road, rail, air, maritime and ICT networks and
infrastructure are aligned and prioritised, based on the demand
and volume of services, as well as future growth in identified
areas;

e Transport and logistic links serve natural resource-based
economies in areas focused on (1) the export of raw materials,
and (2) processing-activities related to mining, agriculture,
forestry and manufacturing;

e Local freight needs, movement, passenger transport
infrastructure and management skills/capabilities are spatially
aligned and phased to support identified nodes and connecting
corridors;

e Effective development of all national ports of entry, including (1)
upgrading and maintenance of logistics infrastructure and (2) the

development on ecological resources and infrastructure systems,
national spatial development and land-use is well-planned and
effectively managed.

4.6 Putting it All Together: Life in South Africa 2050:
The Long-Term National Spatial Development
Vision, Logic and Levers in Action

In this section, the 2050-National Spatial Development Vision as tangible
expression of what the desired future will entail once the Post-Apartheid
National Spatial Development Vision, Logic and Levers have been put
into action, is presented. It reads as follows...

75 Million South Africans

It is April 2050. A year earlier, during South Africa’s 55!* ‘27 April-
Democracy Celebrations’, the 75" million South African was born in the
Buffalo City urban region. This massive urban conglomeration, is one of
the ‘big four’ urban conurbations along the South African east coast,
that are now jointly home to more than eight million South Africans. These
four urban conurbations have grown rapidly — their growth equalling that
of the Cape Town urban region, with its more than six million inhabitants.
Despite their rapid growth, they are still a long way off from the Gauteng

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

urban region with its population of more than 22 million people. Together
with the booming cities of Polokwane, Mbombela, Rustenburg, Msunduzi
and Mangaung, each with their populations of around 1 million people,
the eleven urban conurbations are now home to around 42 million
people, or around 60% of the South African population (see Figure 36).

 Eleven Urban Conurbations

In contrast to days gone by in which large parts of metropolitan South
Africa were described as lifeless and boring, these areas are now hives
of activity. Three-to-six storey mixed-use buildings are the norm in the
buzzing former inner-city areas and along dense activity-streets in many
of the suburbs of these erstwhile cities. Rooftops are in most cases used
for (1) food production, preparation and distribution, (2) Pop-Up Music
performances, (3) poetry nights, and (4) plays. Some of them are used
for solar and wind energy generation, alongside a myriad of other ways
of doing so (1) on buildings and verandas, and (2) in larger commercial
energy farms on high-lying areas and in the ocean, alongside the
numerous thriving aquaculture projects.

Trade with African countries along the east coast of the continent, as well
as with India and China, has boomed over the last three decades. In
contrast to days gone by, this is far less in the form of the export of raw
commodities, some of which are no longer shipped, such as coal, due to
international carbon-trade-bans dating back to the early 2030s. These
days, South Africa is a major exporter of a wide range of high-value hand-
made high-fashion clothing, jewellery, art, furniture, foodstuffs and
beverages, which have become highly sought after in countries where
nearly everything is made by machine. A key contributor to this new
dawn for South Africa was the unveiling by government in the early 2020s
of its massive and hugely successful ‘Smart Reindustrialisation
Programme’ and its ‘Eastern South Africa Development Plan’. Driven by
(1) the evermore-pressing drought in the western and north-western parts
of the country, (2) the unfulfilled and deferred promise of the democracy
that was won at such a high cost, and (3) the enormous agriculture,
industrial and settlement development opportunities that lay east, and
that were unlocked by the massive ‘New Land Reform Programme’ of
the 2020s, government acted swiftly and decisively. And now, 25-30 years
on, this is the outcome.

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

Transformation at Scale

The massive national-led ‘macro-restructuring and development plans’
not only resulted in shared economic growth and poverty alleviation at
scale, but also assisted in inculcating a culture of ‘all-in’, targeted,
integrated and coordinated planning. Out the door went untargeted,
unplanned and unintegrated investment by government and the private
sector, and the wastage of time and money by everyone pursuing their
own plans and projects in their own backyards. In contrast to the early
days of SPLUMA, when the introduction of the new suite of spatial
planning instruments had very little impact on ridding the country of the
legacy of colonial and Apartheid planning, the Act is now (1) used as
intended, and (2) respected by government, communities and the
private sector alike.

In addition to the positive impacts the macro-restructuring and
development plans had on the national spatial development planning
system, the success of these plans assisted in making South Africans
believe that they can, and that it was possible fo develop a truly
transformed, liberated and prosperous post-Apartheid South Africa. The
fruits of this freed-up, confident country are everywhere to be seen - from
the dynamic interplay between (1) well-targeted, wise government
investment and (2) innovative, organic urban growth and land
development by communities, to the booming SADC region. It is
especially this regional bloc and the connections and free flow of goods,
services and people that it has enabled, that have played a huge role in
the national economic growth rate of on average between 3% and 6%
since the mid-2020s. The benefits have not only been felt on the national
level and in the big urban areas, as also smaller towns and rural areas
have gained from it. Thinking SADC, nationally and locally when planning
and investing in infrastructure, played a huge role in this success.

104
 A Good Life in Urban South Africa

Life on the streets of urban South Africa is very different to the first two
decades of the 2000s. In contrast to life back then, the streets are now
filled with people and there is excitement in the air. There are now also
far fewer cars in the streets, and all you hear is people's voices and music
— walking and cycling are now the most popular means of moving
around, and the electrical buses and taxis barely make a noise. Instead
of pavements packed with cars, there now are (1) many small places to
eat, (2) salons where you can have your hair done, (3) little shops selling
anything from fresh produce to health foods, (4) research, education
and innovation institutes, where knowledge and ideas flow freely, and
(5) art and culture academies, where young artists are primed, and
where you can enjoy music, poetry and short plays and buy paintings
and sculptures. And it is here, in the vibrant streets and surrounding public
spaces that never sleep, where many of the more than 75% of South
Africans who now call ‘the city’ their home, make a life and live much of
their lives. It is also here where South Africa and the rest of the world meet
— where you see faces and hear languages from all over the planet.
Many of these voices are those of tourists who love the vibrant and
unique cosmopolitan atmosphere, and who have made South Africa
one of the top ten tourist destinations in the world for the last 26 years in
a row. Again, it was the foresight and decisive actions of government in
the 2020s that succeeded in growing the sector into one of the largest
and most dynamic in the country.

A Good Life in Rural South Africa

Rural South Africa is also in a very different shape to what is was in the
late 2010s when it was a hard place to grow up in, money was tight, jobs
were few and government services in many places non-existent or weak.
This all started changing for the better when government launched its
grant-funded ‘National Spatial Restructuring Priority Plans’ in the early

Draft National Spatial Development Framework 2019

2020s, with their focus on developing ‘functional rural regions’ throughout
rural South Africa, and which entailed the carefully planned roll-out and
provision of quality services in each of these regions in a systemic way in
accordance with government's so-called ‘social services wheel’. In
many rural towns, there are now clinics, police stations, schools, arts and
culture academies and sporting facilities, and even the smallest villages
have lightning-fast communication networks. Hundreds of thousands of
graduates deployed over the many years as interns, researchers, and
tutors to rural schools, also assisted in making these plans a success. Very
soon trade connections between smaller places in rural South Africa
started growing, which soon saw the development of strong rural regions
in areas where once there was little else but destitution and despair. At
the same time, with the growing movement of millions of retired South
Africans to rural areas, the economies of these places have been given
a strong and stable financial injection.

A Young, Free and Creative Country

Today, 56 years into democracy, South Africa is finally beginning to enjoy
the full dividend of freedom and is fully able to (1) harness the energy,
creativity and vitality of its many young people, and (2) fuse it with the
innovative flares and creative blazes of young people from the rest of the
continent and all over the world.

PART FIVE: National Spatial Development and Investment
Guidance

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 
 5.1

Introduction

In this part of the NSDF, the desired Ideal National Spatial Development
Pattern for South Africa in 2050 is put forward. The National Spatial
Development Frame: Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern (see
Figure 39) provides an image of a:

Resilient, sustainable and inclusive post-Apartheid national spatial
development pattern that is well-served by a consolidated
system of international, national and regional development
nodes and corridors, with a highly productive network of rural
regions, where development nodes, rural regions and hard
infrastructure are embedded within the capabilities and
interdependencies of the national ecological infrastructure
system.

This ideal pattern is ‘detailed-out’ in five ‘Sub-Frames’*. These five Sub-
Frames are:

NSDF Sub-Frame One: Inter-Regional Connectivity:

NSDF Sub-Frame Two: The National System of Nodes and
Corridors;

NSDF Sub-Frame Three: The National Resource Economy Regions;
NSDF Sub-Frame Four: The National Movement and Connectivity
Infrastructure System; and

NSDF Sub-Frame Five: The National Ecological Infrastructure and
Natural Resource System.

This Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern and the five Sub-Frames
were constructed:

ideal National

in constructing — this Spatial

Development Pattern and the five Sub-Frames were:

National spatial development realities and national and
international frends, movement patterns and technological
advances, and (1) the challenges they present, and (2) the
opportunities they offer;

A significant growth in our national population of between 17 and
22 million people between today and 2050;

The (1) unique development potentials of places and areas, and
(2) the roles they will have to play in national, regional and local
economies, to realise our national development objectives of
inclusive economic growth, job creation and _ poverty
eradication;

The need to (1) safeguard national food security, (2) make the
transition to a low-carbon energy future, (3) ensure adequate
provision of safe and affordable water, (4) protect, manage and
maintain key ecosystems and the services they provide, and (5)
recognise the inferconnectedness and_ interdependencies
between places; and

The multiple threats associated with climate change, such as (1)
rising temperatures in the western and central parts of the
country, (2) reduced water availability, and (3) growing
unpredictability in the seasonal pattern of rainfall.

108
 Together, the Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern and the five
Sub-Frames provide:

A national spatial schema to inform, direct, prioritise and guide alll
future infrastructure investment and development spending
decisions by government and the private sector, to (1) optimise
place-based potentials and spatial interdependencies, and (2)
realise the 2050-National Spatial Development Vision and our
core national development objectives, as encapsulated in our
National Development Paradigm;

Strategic spatial development and investment guidance to
spatially direct plans, budgets and actions of public and private
sector actors, to, over time (1) capitalise on key national spatial
assets, locational potentials and agglomeration opportunities,
and (2) bring about decisive, rapid, sustainable and inclusive
national development and transformation at scale;

A carefully chosen, distinct set of nationally-significant places,
connectors and areas in and around which to align, integrate
and coordinate investment by the private sector and the three
spheres of government when preparing and reviewing (1)
area/place-based provincial, regional and municipal SDFs, and
(2) sector-specific and macro-infrastructure national and SADC-
focused investment plans;

A brief outline of the key role-players responsible for driving
spatial transformation, national adaptation and ‘national spatial
development accountability’, as well as (1) the institutions that
will be involved, and (2) the instruments that will be used in all
three these regards; and

A spatially-explicit assessment and accounting frame for
monitoring and evaluating all spending and investment decisions
by government and the private sector in space (specific places

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

and interrelated spaces) and time (the short, medium and long-
term).

Following on from the ideal spatial pattern and the sub-frames, is a set of
five National Spatial Action Areas (NSAAs). These NSAAs represent the
most urgent strategic spatial development catalysts to (1) bring about
radical spatial transformation at scale, and (2) manage and mitigate
rising national risks, and as such, require immediate national action.
Concerted and sustained intergovernmental collaboration is required in
these NSAAs over the short term to:

Target context-specific, focused and catalytic national spatial
development interventions; and

Kickstart the process of aligning plans, budgets and
departmental plans in and between spheres of government
around national spatial development priorities.

 5.2. NSDF Sub-Frame One: Inter-Regional
Connectivity

5.2.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance

Supra-national development and investment in four inter-regional spatial
networks are of particular importance to South Africa (see Figure 40).
These relate to (1) energy supply, (2) transport and logistics services, (3)
shared water resources, and (4) ecological infrastructure:

e Regionally-connected electricity networks enable South Africa to (1)
buy electricity from Lesotho, Mozambique and Namibia when surplus
is required, or (2) sell to Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe when it has excess production.
The SADC Energy Sector Plan indicates that, apart from the
infrastructure projects in South Africa, there are also a number of
planned (or by now current) projects aimed at increasing power
generation in the region.x' Nationally, these are also under
consideration through the Electricity Grid Infrastructure and Gas
Pipeline Extension programme, for which a national Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) process is currently underway.
Renewable energy has emerged as a rapidly-growing source that
can add vastly to the energy mix in the region. Renewable energy
projects have, however, faced serious challenges related to a lack
of (1) policy and regulation, and (2) connecting infrastructure and
financing.

e Transport and logistics infrastructure has been identified as key to
creating an enabling environment to (1) achieving the goal of
sustainable regional socio-economic development, and (2) closing
the widening gap in the provision of high-quality, efficient

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

infrastructure, especially when considering road and _ rai
infrastructure. In response to this, SADC adopted a_ spatia
development corridor strategy in 2008. While railway lines are
considered as crucial for (1) improved efficiency of movement o
freight in the region, and (2) the protection of infrastructure
investment in the regional road network, the railway network has seen
only minimal improvement, revitalisation and expansion. Poor road
quality and lack of maintenance in certain areas remain a critica
concern in the case of both regional and urban roads. Although
capacity currently exists on the road network, projections for 2027
suggest the need for (1) further road-widening, (2) the construction
of bypasses for major cities and passing-lanes in hilly regions, and (3
more efficient border-posts.xi While the SADC railways generally
operate far below their original design capacities, they canno
increase their volumes because of (1) poor track condition, (2) lack
of locomotive and wagon availability, and (3) low operating capital.
With regards to new railway investments directly impacting upon or
driven by South Africa, the TRANSNET rail investment plan indicates a
new rail line to Botswana (the Lephalale-Mahalapye line) for coal
transport, as well as the upgrading of several lines to the major
regional harbours, to support mineral exports.

 

Water availability across SADC varies. The countries with the greatest
demand unfortunately also have the most limited supply. South Africa
shares several water catchment basins with neighbouring countries
including (1) the Orange-Senqu basin (Namibia and Botswana), (2)
the Limpopo basin (Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique), (3) the
Inkomati basin (Swaziland and Mozambique), and (4) the Maputo-
Usungo-Pangola Basin (Swaziland and Mozambique). It is projected
that by 2025, two of South Africa's major river basins (the Orange-
Senqu and the Limpopo basin) will be under stress, i.e. meaning they
will have less than 500 cubic metres of water available per person

a2
 annually” The SADC-Protocol establishes a legally-binding
framework for transboundary water management in the region.
Within the context of recent water challenges to sustain livelihoods,
agriculture, mining, industrial and service economies in our country,
the regional importance of (1) transboundary water management,
and (2) sustained and enhanced biodiversity and natural
ecosystems, including wetlands (which are also the bases for viable
rural livelihoods and tourism) is clearly evident.

e Ecological infrastructure management and collaboration regarding
risk management and beneficiation associated with identified
strategic national protected and management areas within SADC is
of critical importance for South Africa to reach national development
objectives and international agreements.

The priorities related to supra-national cross-border and regional inter-
relations can be summarised as follows:

e Facilitation of trade and movement in the SADC trade bloc;

e Strengthening and expansion of South Africa's role in facilitating
inter-regional trade and providing regional gateways (i.e. our
core urban regions and nodes) (see NSDF Sub-Frames 2 and 3);

e Protection of strategic regional ecosystems and bio-diversity
through shared management of International Transfrontier Parks;
and

e Effective and efficient management of cross-border movement,
service delivery and inter-regional migration.

Nodes and Corridors

5.3.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance

Settlement development, both in urban and rural South Africa, must be
undertaken in such a way that it (1) increases development density, (2)
reduces urban sprawl, (3) prevents the unsustainable use of productive
land, and (4) optimises investment in infrastructure networks (see Figure
41).

Inclusive economic development, livelihoods, land and housing: In
accordance with this objective, municipalities, supported by provincial
and national government sector departments, must:

e Prepare and implement appropriate local and regional
economic interventions;

e Enable and support a wide spectrum of livelihood opportunities;

e Ensure timeous identification, acquisition and release of well-
located land; and

e Make provision for a diverse range of housing options for a diverse
range of household types.x”

In rural settlements, it is imperative that (1) environmentally-sensitive
settlement planning be undertaken, (2) ‘rural design’ be introduced, and
(3) viable, new agri-eco-focussed enterprises be established and existing
ones supported.

Social services and settlements: If South Africa is to meet the social needs
of its very young, but also increasingly older population, then a rational

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

process of providing social infrastructure is required. The NSDF is therefore
underpinned by a ‘national settlement service provision framework
system’ in terms of which social services are provided in accordance with
the (1) role and (2) service-reach of the type of settlement on the
national settlement network. This system provides the basis for guiding
investment in infrastructure and social services, especially by national
sector departments (see Figure 42). However, this system will only work if
government as a whole adopts it to guide its social infrastructure
planning and investment. As a starting point, it is recommended that
priority be given to embedding this system in all of government.

National and regional connectivity: The national network of nodes,
smaller settlements and corridors requires that (1) national nodes and
smaller settlements are well-connected to each other, and (2) national
nodes are well-connected to the rest of the world though a range of
transport modes and communications networks. This requires that:

e Road and rail routes that are of national importance be built,
maintained and upgraded, as and where necessary;

e Rail be prioritised over road for freight movement; and

e The availability, affordability, safety and quality of mass public
passenger transport be drastically improved.

Water availability: Given our dire water situation, water demand must be
curbed, water sources must be augmented, and the little water we have,
protected from loss through well-maintained infrastructure. In addition to
this, (1) our ecological infrastructure must be protected and its use be
well managed, and (2) new settlement development must be restricted
and existing settlement growth carefully managed in water-stressed
catchments and regions.

e Effectively utilise, protect and manage high-value agricultural lands, ecological infrastructure and national
manmade and natural environmental assets, and mitigate down-stream impacts on water bodies, water
catchments and other natural resources.

e Actively support national and international programmes aimed at climate change mitigation of CO2-
emissions, and introduce local policies and measures to assist such programmes.

e Utilise innovation, enterprise development and job creation opportunities in (1) agro-eco-industries, (2)
tertiary and service sectors, (3) tourism, (4) knowledge-creation, and (5) cultural and entertainment industries.

e Maintain and upgrade road and rail routes in urban regions. Prioritise rail for bulk freight, and improve the
affordability of intercity public passenger transport.

Prioritise and strengthen strategically located regional development anchor towns in productive rural regions
and priority national development, trade and transport corridors to provide (1) a range of services within the
specific towns/cities and surrounding network of settlements and productive rural regions (see Figures 40 and
41 and Annexure B for a list of towns and cities).

Support and strengthen strategically located regional development anchors through (1) targeted settlement
planning and development, (2) higher-order social infrastructure provision, and (3) focused support for smalll
and medium-sized enterprise development, industrialisation and economic diversification.

Use the investment and enhanced social service provision (see Figure 42) in regional development anchors
to encourage officials working in these rural regions to stay in these settlements and contribute to the local
economy, instead of commuting to larger towns or cities on a daily or weekly basis.

Clearly identify the role of specific settlements as gateways and interchanges on the regional public
transportation network, and incorporate these as such into the planning of functional rural regions.
Strengthen the connectivity of traditional areas and rural settlements with (1) higher-order urban settlements,
and (2) economic systems in functional rural regions, by making use of the road and rail network and regional
corridor development.

Plan social infrastructure provision within a regional-rural setting using the ‘social services wheel’, and use
such investment to establish and create well-functioning, compact, lively, rural settlements and regional rural
systems (see Figure 42 and Annexure B).

e — Rural development must be supported though a hierarchical network of prioritised service centres (see Figure
42 and Annexure B) where people in rural areas and settlements can optimally be provided with core
municipal services, social and government services, and where rural logistics and support can be provided
to optimally support rural development.

© — Towns that act as border and trade posts need special attention.

e In arid areas and areas experiencing a decline in population, settlements must be consolidated and
maintenance prioritised in such core towns.

e In dense rural settlement regions, consolidation within nodal centres and rural design is required.

popular tourist destinations, comfortable climatic zones and urban nodes.

e — This corridor also provides opportunities for the consolidation of existing cities and the development of ‘new’
cities supported by well-developed multi-modal connectivity infrastructure. This requires that:

Port and airport development be strengthened in support of inter-regional trade flows and efficiency;

and

 5.3.4 National Action and Key Role-Players

Strategic investment in national urban growth regions will require (1) high
levels of intergovernmental coordination and alignment, as well as (2)
the introduction of ‘joint national spatial accountability’ in terms of the
achievement of national spatial development outcomes. Crucial actions
that will have to be undertaken in these regards are the following:

e Urban areas experiencing large-scale urbanisation will need (1) the
support of initiatives such as the IUDF and the DHS’s long-term housing
plans, with a focus on ensuring financial viability in human settlement
development, and (2) regional-scale collaboration, with a focus on
private sector, civil society and city government involvement;

* Coordination will need to be done between long-term infrastructure
planning, implementation and maintenance, with a specific focus on
(1) national water storage, allocation and availability, and (2) the
national rail and road network, which necessitates harmonisation
between IPAP, NATMAP 2050 and the NSDF;

e Capacity shortfalls in the construction, maintenance and upgrading
of bulk water, energy and transport infrastructure at local level will
require dedicated support from the national and_ provincial
departments responsible for municipal and spatial planning, with
care having to be taken to ensure that such support assists in the
creation and maintenance of resilient and sustainable urban regions;
and

e Urban land reform and the timeous release of suitable land in the right
places must be done, which may require the provision of support to
municipalities with (1) the identification, acquisition and release of
such land, and (2) the use of such land in ensuring catalytic
development, spatial transformation and inclusive growth.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 5.4 NSDF Sub-Frame Three: National Resource
Economy Regions

5.4.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance

Spatial development and investment directives and identified national
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national
resource economy regions (see Figure 43) are outlined below.

Rural regions and regional development anchors: The development of
productive, functional rural regions throughout South Africa requires:

e The development of viable, robust and resilient regional rural
economies that recognise and respect the limitations and
interdependencies of the national ecological infrastructure and
natural resources on which they depend;

e The (1) ‘delineation’ of functional rural regions, and (2) the
identification of regional development anchors in such regions
that are located on the national transport network;

e High levels of (1) national-regional connectivity between such
regional development anchors, and urban nodes and regions,
and (2) regional-local connectivity between such anchors and
the towns and villages in their respective regions; and

e Sound spatial planning, consolidation of the urban development,
and minimisation of the urban footprint, in such regions.

Diversity, strengths and cautions: While the concept of regional rural
development is a generic one, the spaces in which it is to be utilised are
far from that. When considering the diverse endowments and assets of
these rural regions, it emerges that:

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

e The eastern half of the country has areas with moderate to high
levels of ‘agricultural potential’:

o Although agriculture has been developed in many of the
areas where this potential exists, there still remain areas of
high-agricultural potential that have not yet been fully
utilised; and

o Atthesame time, there are also significant areas of dense
human settlement on high-value agricultural land;

e The western half of the country has less agricultural potential,
primarily due to far less annual rainfall in these areas than in the
eastern half of the country:

o Regions in this half of the country do, however, have a
range of other opportunities, notably — tourism,
conservation and mineral-resource extraction;

e Both halves (east and west) hold most of the key national ground
and surface-water production areas that are critical for water
supply to the country’s major urban regions, cities and towns,
and, as such, this necessitate spatial planning, wise use of natural
resources and effective land use management; and

e A number of key national conservation areas also feature
prominently in the areas identified as productive rural regions,
and although some communities already do benefit from these
resources, much more can be gained from this relationship,
notably in the area of eco-tourism and management of
ecological infrastructure.

Sustainable resource use and land-use management: Intergovernmental
cooperation and collaboration in (1) the development of productive
rural regions, and (2) the management of natural resource use in such
regions will be required. This is especially important in municipalities with
significant parcels of high-value agricultural land that are under pressure
from human settlement and/or mining. The focus of such collaboration,

123
 which should have a (1) spatial planning, (2) land use management and
(3) inclusive growth component, must af least be on:

e Water security, including the mitigation of the impacts of regional
rural development on national water resource availability and
quality;

e Food security, including (1) the sustainable use of high-value
agricultural land, and (2) the protection of national food
production areas; and

e Land reform, including (1) the pursuit of justice in access to high-
value agricultural land, and (2) the provision of support to new
and emerging farmers in such areas.

Climate change adaptation: Climate change in the form of (1) less rain,
(2) greater unpredictability in rainfall, (3) higher temperatures, (4) more
very hot days, and (5) a greater risk of veld-fires, has far-reaching
implications for agricultural produce and habitation in all of South
Africa’s productive rural regions. Even in regions where the impacts of
climate change will be less severe, the more severe impacts in other
regions will lead to increased pressure on the use of land and other
natural resources in such ‘less severely affected regions’.

In order to counter and mitigate the impacts of climate change,
innovative agricultural adaptation, involving a move to (1) agricultural
commodities that are more resistant to extreme and harsh conditions,
and (2) agricultural practices that are better suited to the anticipated
adverse climatic conditions, will be required. At the same time, climate
change may open up opportunities for new economic activities in some
regions, notably in the area of solar energy generation.

This arid area has extensive agricultural activities, with (1) pockets and stretches of intensive
irrigation-farming, (2) mining clusters, (3) renewable energy farms/plants, and (4) small,
compact settlements.

The impact of climate change in the already drier and hotter western parts of the country
(where large areas of locally-significant agricultural activities from an (1) economic activity
and (2) job-provision perspective are located) will require regional agricultural adaptation-
support and effective land use management.

Innovative farming techniques and technologies must be introduced and supported in
selected arid and semi-arid areas of the country, by making wise and smart use of
groundwater and/or water transfers.

Regional development initiatives to share capacity, research and innovation in support of
innovative regional development must be encouraged.

Mining and Energy Production Areas and Supportive Infrastructure

Collaborative, long-term regional development in new mining exploration areas is required,
which includes (1) scenario development, (2) population migration projections, (3)
diversification strategies, (4) cost/benefit-modelling of regional infrastructure provision,
municipal service delivery, and the cumulative impacts of the mining activities, and (5) the
optimisation of regional and local development opportunities.

Rehabilitation and negative impact mitigation must extend beyond agreements on paper
and be enforced on the ground.

In the case of new mines, where (1) the levels of automation and mechanisation are low,
and (2) sizeable numbers of workers will still be required, housing provision and/or settlement
expansion must take place in regional development anchors or existing small fowns where
adequate social services are available. In deciding on the licencing of such new mining
operations, (1) national and regional development priorities, and (2) the cumulative impacts
of the envisaged mining activities and further such activities on the creation of functional
rural regions must be considered. Where possible, mining companies should become far
more involved in the development of functional, resilient rural regions, which may include
investments in (1) hard, transport and connectivity, and (2) soft, social services-infrastructure.
Limit development of new mining-dependent towns.

Support and diversify economies in declining mining towns and regions.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 

National Spatial Development Priorities

Q

Existing Productive Rural Regions to be Strengthened:

e Long-term infrastructure planning must be informed by
changes in the mining industry;

e Regional development and resource management must be
used to support further mining and associated activities in
the northern mining regions; and

e In national urban regions, enterprise opportunities, large-
scale innovations in service delivery and disruptive
technologies need to be researched and explored, to
support urban economies and national well-being.

Support in Stressed Rural Regions:

eThe Mpumalanga Coal Mining and Coal Fired Power Plant
Region will come under increased pressure as a result of (1)
environmental concerns, (2) a possible decline in the
demand for coal, and (3) large-scale employment losses,
which requires regional-scale and industry-orientated
innovation and the introduction of measures to reduce
emissions; and

e Within remote and arid regions in the western and north-
western parts of the couniry, the cumulative impact of a
growing number of wind farms, solar plants and mining and
energy-related projects should be carefully evaluated in
regional context. The growth of existing towns close to these
areas is supported, but new and on-site settlement far away
from existing towns is not.

129
 5.4.3 National Action and Key Role-Players

The strategic development of productive rural regions and regional
development anchors, and the consolidation of regional settlement
patterns, will require (1) high levels of intergovernmental coordination
and alignment, as well as (2) the introduction of ‘joint accountability’ in
terms of the achievement of clearly-defined regional spatial
development outcomes. Crucial actions that will have to be undertaken
in these regards are the following:

e Ensuring broad-based support for the regional-rural development
approach, and sustained, active collaboration by national and
provincial sector departments, traditional leaders, municipalities,
the private sector and communities in (1) undertaking the
necessary regional-rural planning and related long-term
infrastructure investment, (2) tying-in key settlement development
plans and initiatives, such as the IUDF, the DHS’s long-term housing
plans, and municipal IDPs and SDFs to these regional-rural plans,
(3) implementing the plans in a coordinated and integrated
manner, (4) monitoring the implementation of the plans, and (5)
building the necessary capacity to undertake such regional rural
planning and development; and

e Supporting national food security through the protection and
productive use of high-value agriculture land, as identified and
directed by DAFF, and ensuring that all relevant national and
provincial sector departments and municipalities account for
their use and management of high-value agricultural land; and

e Pursuing and assisting with initiatives aimed at regional economic
diversification and transition in mining-dependent areas, which
may involve (1) scenario development, (2) research, (3) piloting
of proposals, and (4) the provision of enterprise development and
support, and entail the involvement of a wide range of role-

 5.5 NSDF Sub-Frame Four: National Movement
and Connectivity Infrastructure System

5.5.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance

Spatial development and investment directives and identified national
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national
connecting and movement infrastructure (see Figure 44) are outlined
below.

Long-term planning and investment: Given the high costs and long life-
cycles involved in large scale infrastructure investment, timeous planning,
evaluation and design of appropriate geo-specific national economic
infrastructure is critical. Transitions in (1) national settlement patterns, (2)
major economic activities and sectors, (3) climate change, and (4)
technological advances, notably in transport, energy generation and
communication networks need to be planned for well in advance, and
modes and patterns of infrastructure investment adjusted accordingly.
These actions require (1) the phasing of new connections and extensions,
and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, and (2) the initiation of
collaborative long-term planning with regards to national and inter-
regional land and sea-based connecting and enabling infrastructure.

Movement and connection infrastructure networks: These networks are
fundamental to (1) national spatial development, (2) the utilisation of
national economic opportunities, (3) the creation of a national system of
national urban cores, smaller settlements and national spatial
development corridors, and (4) international, continental and SADC
trade and connectivity. The effective functioning of these networks
requires that:

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

e Investment in rail is prioritised over road for economic, ecological and
efficiency reasons;

e — Rail infrastructure is rehabilitated and expanded to support national
freight movement and trade with SADC;

e All the roads in the core national network are appropriately surfaced
and the key routes prioritised for regular maintenance;

e Logistics hubs, ports (airports and harbours) and border posts are
maintained and expanded, as and where necessary, to keep pace
with national economic growth and reduce delays at ports; and

e ICT networks are extended to the whole country with national
corridors, urban regions, cities, regional development anchors, and
rural service centres being prioritised, and the rest of the country
incrementally covered over time.

Energy-transmission networks: Maintenance of the national electricity
grid infrastructure is crucial and timeous expansion of the network must
be done as and where required from a national development
perspective. Where new sources of energy are to be introduced to the
national energy mix, the following should be observed:

e Solar and wind: Production is to be located in close proximity to the
national grid or users, and in distributed networks in low-density
areas/small remote towns where it should be delivered though smalll-
scale distributed networks;

e Nuclear: Nuclear power stations must be located in close proximity
to large water bodies (for cooling) and the existing national
distribution network; and

e Gas: Gas pipelines must be spatially located in such a way that they
do not encumber, but support national economic development.

 5.5.3. National Action and Key Role-Players

The maintenance, expansion and upgrading of the country’s national
transport and communications network will require coordination and
collaboration by a variety of role-players, notably the NDoT, the DMR,
the DoE, the DWS, the NPC, the PICC, ESKOM, SANRAL, PRASA, provincial
sector departments responsible for long term infrastructure planning
and development, municipalities, mining companies, organised labour
and community representatives. The huge costs involved in such
maintenance, expansion and upgrading, and the many other pressing
development needs may lead to it being neglected. Ways in which
timeous planning, budgeting and investment can be secured are as
follows:

e Preparing a long-term national infrastructure plan that is aligned with
the NSDF, (1) using the appropriate scenario development
modelling techniques, (2) with involvement of a wide range of role-
players and interest groups, including communities, and (3)
introducing a phased approach to spread the cost of time;

e Creating a broad-based awareness of national and supra-national
interdependencies and the need for investing in the network;

e Building the necessary capacities amongst the key role-players;

e Introducing a coordinating and monitoring institution, and providing
regular updates as to the state of the network; and

e Using the NSDF’s envisaged ‘national spatial accountability system’
to monitor the contribution of key role-players in the maintenance,
expansion and upgrading of the network in accordance with the
national plan.

Infrastructure and Natural Resource System

5.6.1 Spatial Development and Investment Guidance

Spatial development and investment directives and identified national
spatial development priorities to develop the envisaged national
ecological infrastructure and natural resource system (see Figure 45) are
outlined below.

Protecting the national ecological infrastructure and natural resource
system: This ‘system’ provides a natural resource foundation that enables
all human life and activities in the country, and must, as such, be wisely
used, managed and protected. It includes areas regarded as strategic
assets within the country’s national and international biodiversity,
ecology and tourism areas (including Ramsar Sites and Transfrontier
Parks). The protection of this system requires that:

« National spatial development is well-planned and well-managed
to (1) limit negative impacts on the ecological infrastructure
system, (2) ensure that urban growth and land use fits within
national and regional water resource availability profiles, and (3)
ensure that land and/or settlement development does not
threaten or compromise strategic surface and groundwater
water production areas (see Annexure B);

e National water use is curbed through effective water demand
management, recycling, infrastructure maintenance and water
augmentation projects; and

e The strategic national water resource infrastructure system is well-
maintained and the restoration of degraded water areas is
prioritised.

National Ecological and Biodiversity Management Areas (see Figure 45)

Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSAs) have been identified
as Priority National Ecological Infrastructure Regions that are of national importance and
development.
Management, productive use and restoration of these areas (1) is a joint responsibility, and (2)
could also be used for the socio-economic benefit of people, cities and economies in the regions
in which they are located.
Land-uses that reduce run-off or stream flow, or affect water-quality (e.g. mining, plantations,
crop production and overgrazing) should be avoided in SWSAs, wetlands should be kept in good
condition or rehabilitated, and invasive alien plants should be cleared. To support this:
e The natural resource foundation and bio-diversity must be conserved in these areas of
national and international significance; and
e CBAs should remain in natural or near-natural ecological condition, i.e. no intensive land uses
should take place in these areas (see Annexure B).
‘Developmental co-benefits’ must be created through effective management and use of
strategic ecological and biodiversity management areas, to support rural livelinoods, especially
with regards to custodianship and tourism opportunities.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 140
 5.6.3 National Action and Key Role-Players

Regulatory implementation with regards to SWSAs is imperative. While
guidelines for the management of development in such areas have
been prepared, further actions have to be taken to see them
implemented, i.e. (1) an intergovernmental team led by DEA and SANBI
has to be put together, (2) awareness of the guidelines must be raised,
and (3) the guidelines must be finalised and promulgated. In the interim,
awareness of these guidelines can and needs to be raised, specifically
with regards to:

e Activities such as (1) agriculture, (2) mining, (3) land and settlement
development, (4) infrastructure investment, and (5) spatial planning
and land use management in areas experiencing § significant
development pressures, such as the three National Transformation
Corridors; and

e° Category 1 of the CBAs, and the implications of this ‘CBA-status’ for
land development and land use management in such areas.

With regards to ‘national spatial accountability’ for the protection of
environmental quality in (1) SWSAs, (2) CBAs: Category 1, and (3)
National Fresh Water Protection Areas, provinces responsible for the
management of these areas, and their upstream impacts, will have to
account for their actions. In addition to this, provincial and municipal
SDFs must ensure that development in such key ecological areas is (1)
not to their detriment, and (2) enhances their ability to provide their
crucial life-enabling and ecological support services. The capacity,
monitoring and support-implications of these roles and duties are
significant, and will need to be jointly attended to by the national sector
departments responsible for environmental affairs and spatial planning.

 5.7. National Spatial Action Areas

5.7.1 Introduction

Following on from the directive in the NDP, the NSDF identifies areas of
significant national risk and potential. In sharp contrast to the centrifugal
forces (i.e. ‘outward-pushing forces away from the core’) that shaped
Apartheid national spatial development planning, the NSDF provides a
development perspective aimed at ‘drawing all South Africans closer to
the core’:

e Nationally, in the form of a shared and smaller, yet more viable,
more sustainable and more resilient national spatial footprint that
places less pressure on our core national natural resource areas
and ecological systems, and is more affordable to service and
sustain;

« Regionally, in functionally integrated areas focused on regional
development and wellbeing that (1) are supported by regional
development collaboration agreements between of State and
non-State actors, and (2) provide an interface between ‘the
national and ‘the local; and

e Locally, in high-quality, serviced, compact, diverse and
connected places with viable, robust and resilient economies.

In order to create such a ‘shared, smaller, better connected and more
sustainable South Africa’, the NSDF identifies the most urgent short-term,
strategic spatial development catalysts to (1) bring about radical spatial
transformation at scale, (2) manage and mitigate rising national risks, and
(3) move our country at speed towards the Ideal National Spatial
Development Pattern (see Figure 46). These are called National Spatial
Action Areas (NSAAs) (see Figure 47)

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Concerted, focused and sustained intergovernmental collaboration is
required in these NSAAs (see Table 1) in the short term to:

e Target national spatial development actions and interventions;
and

e Kickstart the process of aligning plans, budgets and
departmental plans in and between spheres of government
around national spatial development priorities.

The selection of the five tyoes of NSAAs was informed by:

e The challenges and trends that are most likely to impact our
country over the course of the (1) immediate, and (2) medium
and longer-term futures;

e The stated development objectives in national and provincial
development and sector plans; and

e The gap between our national spatial development vision and
the status quo.

The identification of the NSAAs does not propose an overhaul or detailed
spatial alignment of every existing planning instrument or initiative.
Instead the introduction of these priority areas seeks to impact
government processes by:

e Identifying (1) urgently required interventions in national space
and (2) priority spatial development enablers for accelerated
development impact in this space; and

e Restoring and managing the sustainable utilization of our
country’s rich natural resource foundation and ecological
infrastructure.

In the following sections, the NSAAs are briefly outlined, a few key
statistics for each of the provided, and key action areas and role-players
identified. (The statistics were generated by use of the national Mesozone
data set, with the exception of the population growth scenarios for 2030
and 2050, for which the Green Book was used.)

 5.7.2.1 Significance of the National Transformation Corridors as
NSAAs

While these three corridors have their own unique contexts and
challenges, they share many similarities: They all have (1) large, youthful
populations, (2) shared histories of deep deprivation and neglect as
former Apartheid Bantustans, (3) high levels of poverty and
unemployment, and (4) dense and sprawling rural settlement forms. They
are also areas of high ecological value to the country as (1) surface
water producers in the case of the National Coastal Transformation
Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation Corridor, and (2) an
enormous source of groundwater, in the case of the Northwestern
Transformation Corridor. In addition to this, the National Coastal
Transformation Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation
Corridor include large portions of the country’s very limited high-value
agricultural land, and as such are key to the long-term food security of
the country. The Northwestern Transformation Corridor, in turn, includes
crucial cattle and irrigation farming activities.

In terms of climate change predictions, the National Coastal
Transformation Corridor and the Eastern Escarpment Transformation
Corridor, will also be called upon to provide (1) water and food, (2) key
ecosystems services, and (3) a place to call home, due to the relatively
more favourable climatic conditions in these parts of the country vis-a-vis
far less favourable conditions envisaged in the western, north-western
and central parts of the country. In the case of the Northwestern
Transformation Corridor, the area in which it is located is set to
experiences very harsh climatic conditions in the not-too-distant future,
but (1) due to intensive irrigation, farming has become established as a
regionally and nationally important economic activity, and (2) mining
has a become a earner of foreign exchange for the country.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

Given their shared histories, similar challenges, and importance for the
future of the country, declaring these areas as NSAAs is crucial, (1) for the
sake of historical redress, (2) for attending to pressing rural spatial, social
and economic development challenges at scale, (3) for national food
and water security, and (4) for realising our desired future Ideal National
Spatial Development Pattern. Failure to turn the tide on the challenges
these NSAAs face, and ensuring sustainable (1) service delivery, and (2)
regional economic development, would not only be to the detriment of
these areas and the people who live in them, but also the country as a
whole, due to significant regional interdependencies.

5.7.2.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions

Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF
Sub-Frames, the following national priorities require strategic spatial
action to (1) bring about transformation in the national spatial pattern,
(2) enable national and regional-scale climate and developmental
adaptation, and (3) achieve developmental impact at scale:

e Extend and improve the transportation networks, ensure regular
maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure, notably roads,
increase investment in high-speed ICT infrastructure and enhance
urban-rural and rural-rural connectivity;

e Develop a network of (1) strong and vibrant existing and emerging
cities and large towns to fulfil the role of fully-fledged national urban
nodes, (2) viable regional development anchors, and (3) well-
capacitated rural service centres;

e Ensure effective city and town management to prevent sprawl,
ensure innovative settlement planning and urban land reform, well-
managed land-use, enabling infrastructure investment.

e Introduce rural design, urban/rural edges, land administration and
urban land reform, to consolidate place-specific urbanisation in

147
 dense rural settlements within a strategically located network of rural
service centres and towns

e Provide catalytic, innovative and contextually-suitable sustainable
infrastructure, social and basic services to support enterprise
development, well-being and inclusive growth with both an
ecological and human-focussed approach.

e  Prioritise human capital and people-centred enterprise
development, e.g. arts and culture, tourism, knowledge creation,
education and innovation;

e Optimise the agricultural opportunities in the region and support the
establishment of small-scale farming activities, agri-enterprises and
agri-led industrialisation, to foster productive rural regions, enhance
national food security, and strengthen national water security:

e Develop the tourism sector and creative industries in the region, with
an emphasis on small-and-medium-sized farming activities, and
agri-eco production;

e Ensure the protection and management of ecological infrastructure
and national resources and protected areas, including SWSAs and
high-value agricultural land; and

e Establish strong regional growth and development compacts,
including all role-players, i.e. the three spheres of government,
traditional leaders, communities (notably youth), the private sector,
CBOs, NGOs and organised labour, and ensure regional, cross-
provincial and cross-municipal boundary collaborative spatial
development planning and governance.

In the following figures (Figures 49 to 51) and tables (Tables 2 to 7), (1) a
spatial image of each of the three National Transformation Corridors, (2)
a summary of the key statistics regarding each of the corridors, (3) the

 5.7.3.1 Significance of the Central Innovation Belt as NSAA

The area around the core of the Gauteng urban region is spatially
positioned to be an economically strong, diverse production area that
forms an integral part of the core economic driver of the country and
sub-continent. The Central Innovation Belt is a key contributor to national
economic growth and employment and a crucial surface water
production area, i.e. the Vaal Catchment.

The Central Innovation Belt is characterised by:

e Along history of high-value mining and industrial production that is,
and has been, experiencing significant shrinkage and job losses in
some parts, with more very likely to come, which is primarily due to
changes in the demand for resource-based commodities and the
costs of resource extraction;

e Intensive agriculture and related agro-enterprises, as well as tourism
activities that are not necessarily at odds, but also not enhanced by
the mining and industrial activities in the same area;

e Sustained strong natural population growth and in-migration, much
of it driven by the prospect of employment in the mining and
industrial sectors;

e High levels of regional economic and socio-economic vulnerability,
due to the economic decline and job losses and uncertainties about
the future of especially mining in the area; and

e Pressures on natural resources, notably productive agricultural land
and surface water production by population growth, urban sprawl
and pollution.

The eastern part of the Region intersects with another NSAA, i.e. the
Olifants River Catchment in Moumalanga, which is a National Resource
Risk area in Mpumalanga, where similar changes in the mining and
energy-generation sectors, as well as competition for land and water for

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

food production require a transition in the regional economy and
mitigation of environmental risk factors. The Vaal Catchment area covers
the southern portion of the Region, where severe challenges around
contamination have been, and are being experienced.

5.7.3.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions

Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:

e Support large-scale regional economic and employment change in
the region through innovation, diversification, adaptation and the
repurposing of existing industrial land and associated infrastructure;

e Expedite urban and rural land reform, consolidate existing small-and-
medium-scale agriculture support programmes, protect and
optimise high-value agricultural land, and strengthen the focus on
job-intensive agro-processing in the area;

e Introduce a special collaborative programme in government
(including DMR, DTI, CoGTA, DRDLR, DPME, NT, provincial sector
department and municipalities) with a specific focus on ensuring (1)
innovation and economic diversification, and (2) quality human
settlement development in the region, and involve universities,
research councils, the private sector, communities and organised
labour in this urgent initiative; and

e — Establish a joint public-private action group to manage the threat to
nationally and regionally important water and productive land
resources, with the priority being on the impact of formal and informal
urban sprawl, acid mine water, the maintenance of productive
agriculture, especially for small scale farmers close to urban centres,
and the rehabilitation and management of the Vaal system.

In the following figure (Figure 53) and tables (Tables 8 to 9), (1) a spatial
image of the Central Innovation Belt region, (2) a summary of key

 5.7.4.1 Significance of the National Resource Risk Areas as NSAAs

These are areas that are of national importance to the economy of the
country and the lives of its people. They are under severe stress from an
ecological perspective, while also being ‘resource critical regions’ for
other economic sectors, such as mining, agriculture and human
settlement. Water is not only a vital resource in the mining activities that
drive the energy sector, but also crucial for (1) the strong agricultural
sector in these areas, and for (2) energy-generation at coal fired power
plants, i.e. the Olifants, Upper Vaal and Waterberg catchment areas.
Keeping these economies going, and expanding them further, as is
currently happening in a number of these catchment areas, (1) poses a
serious risk to the quantity and quality of the water supplied by these
areas to the country as a whole, and (2) presents the country with a
serious Conundrum and set of trade-offs. At the moment, however, the
trade-offs between water, food and energy security in these areas (and
the knock-on effects in other places) are playing out in a largely ad hoc
way. It is, however, not due to lack of awareness and concern, as
numerous plans refer to the challenge. The problem is that not much has
been done to date, with urgent engagement being required with
regards to the following trade-offs:

e Upper Vaal region (Mpumalanga): Coal mining, energy generation
SWSAs and high-potential agricultural land;

e Greater uMngeni region (KwaZulu-Natal): Water supply for
eThekwini, intensive agriculture and expanding settlements;

e Waterberg region (Limpopo): Mining, water, energy generation and
future expansion of the area driven as a national priority;

e Olifants Water Management Area (Mpumalanga and Limpopo):
Irrigation schemes, major water quality issues, and pressure from
mining activities and energy generation; and

e Berg and Breede River Catchments (Western Cape): High-
production agriculture, food security and water supply for the Cape
Town urban region.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

5.7.4.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions

Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:

e Attend, as a matter of urgency, to areas were land-use and water
competition and pollution are (1) causing severe risks to stressed
catchments in fulfilling their roles, and (2) placing downstream
dependent regions at risk;

e Rehabilitate degraded and/or contaminated areas to play their crucial
roles in national (1) food production, and (2) surface and ground water
production and supply:

e Plan and prepare for climate change, not only in the areas themselves,
but also for the knock-on effects of climate change in other parts of the
country and in neighbouring countries;

e Attend to capacity and resource-constraints at provincial, regional and
local levels, with national sector departments responsible for
environmental affairs and spatial planning playing a key role in this
regard;

e Avoid approving applications and proposals for land-uses that reduce
stream flow or affect water quality (e.g. mining operations and huge
plantations) in SWSAs;

» Keep wetlands in good condition, rehabilitate ones in need of it, and
clear invasive alien plants form these areas;

e Restore, manage and wisely use CBAs and SWSAs to support eco-
enterprise activities and related livelinood opportunities;

e Prepare an integrated development and resource management plans
with an explicitly (1) spatial approach and (2) a strategic national
perspective, for each of these areas, possibly a Regional SDF;x“li and

e Ensure coordinated State intervention in these areas, with provincial
governments, in collaboration with the institution responsible for NSDF
implementation, spearheading such action.

In the following figures (Figures 55 to 59) and tables (Tables 10 to 21), (1)

 5.7.5.1 Significance of the National Urban Regions as NSAAs

More than half of the country's population already live in urban regions
and cities, with this trend set to continue well into the future. In addition
to being ‘home’ to millions of our people, three main urban regions are
also where:

e The bulk of the country’s economic activities, and those economic
activities of highest value, are concentrated;

e The national transition to a high-value service-based economy will
be driven and accomplished;

e Prospects for job creation through upstarts, small-scale activities and
the arts, culture and entertainment industries are greatest;

e The youth dividend must be reaped; and

e The bulk of (1) imports and exports, and (2) tourists visiting the
country, pass through.

As such, these spaces, small in size, but huge in terms of population,
economic activity and opportunity, are fundamental to the future of the
country. Powerful as they are, they are struggling to deal with the
challenges of service provision, housing, unemployment, crime,
environmental degradation, transport and infrastructure maintenance. |
addition to this, they also still struggle with the legacy of spatial
segregation and exclusion.

Due to their economic and social significance, these regions face not
only natural population growth but also in-migration of people hoping to
tap into the benefits and opportunities of urban areas. Ensuring not only
sustainable economic growth, but also spatial transformation and
inclusive economic growth in these regions will be key contributors to
realising the desired Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

5.7.5.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions

Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:

e Plan for and undertake infrastructure maintenance at scale, to (1)
ensure economic vitality, and (2) avoid human health and safety
risks because of ageing infrastructure, lack of maintenance and
damage by climate change-related hazards on water, sanitation,
storm water, transport and electricity networks;

e Develop specific funding, land access, land tenure and service
provision mechanisms to (1) enable higher residential densities, (2)
provide a range of housing options, (3) alleviate pressure on basic
and social service provision, (4) optimise urban land reform
dividends, (5) manage urban growth, and (6) provide effective mass
public transport;

e Support small-scale farmers in the regions to improve food security
and employment;

e Support innovation and skills development in growing economic
sectors, with a focus on youth development and employment at
scale;

e Support and maintain key export routes and ports; and

e Prepare for climate change by amongst other measures, initiating
an in-depth study into fhe long-term impacts of climate change on
the core urban areas of the country, and developing mitigation and
adaptation strategies, e.g. desalination, urban food production,
and low/no-carbon energy generation, based on the findings of the
study.

In the following figures (Figures 61 to 63) and tables (Tables 22 to 27), (1)
a spatial image of each of the three National Urban Regions, (2) a
summary of the key statistics regarding each of the regions, (3) the names
of the affected municipalities in each of the regions, and (4) the names
of the key settlements in each of the regions is provided.

RID-INNOVATION REGION

DEVELOPMENT OBSTACLES/CHALLENGES

171
 5.7.6.1 Significance of the Arid Innovation Region as NSAA

This region comprises the arid and sparsely populated western and
southwestern central parts of the country. It is set to be significantly
affected by future climate change trends, notably (1) higher
temperatures and (2) less rainfall in large parts of the region, requiring a
consolidated response.

In terms of the key characteristics of region:

e The towns, their inhabitants, their economies and the economy of
the wider arid region in which they are located, are under constant
threat from a limited availability of water; and

« Most of the towns are heavily reliant on a single economic sector,
typically agriculture or mining. This makes them very vulnerable to
(1) external factors, such as currency fluctuations, trade disputes
and changes in the demand for commodities, and (2) more local
factors, notably climate change in the form of a significant rise in
temperature, more very hot days, a greater risk of veld fires, and the
advent of even drier conditions and water shortages.

Due to current challenges and increasing climatic pressures, this region
requires a range of targeted interventions. This is necessary to ensure the
future well-being of its inhabitants, the health of its economy and the
sustainable use of its natural resources. It is also important to harness the
nationally significant opportunities of this region, including its niche
agricultural activities and fisheries, mineral deposits, potential for
alternative energy generation and contribution to the international
scientific community through the SKA.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

5.7.6.2 Focus of Actions and Interventions

Guided by the Ideal National Spatial Development Patterns and the NSDF
Sub-Frames, the following proposals are made:

e Pursue regional adaptation, economic diversification and agri-
innovation at scale, to ensure greater resilience of livelinoods in the
region;

e Limit expansion and development of new settlements in very arid
areas, and pursue and support compact settlement development
around social service nodes and taxi routes in towns and villages,
within assured water availability limits;

e Enhance regional, cross-provincial and cross-municipal boundary
collaborative spatial development planning and governance;

e Establish strong regional growth and development compacts,
including all role-players, i.e. the three spheres of government,
traditional leaders, communities (notably youth), the private sector,
CBOs, NGOs and organised labour;**

e Encourage and support inhabitants of such towns to become self-
sufficient and ‘go off the gird’ with regards to (1) water, electricity
and sanitation services, and (2) food production;

e Enhance ICT linkages, to support distance-learning and provide
access to other social services; and

e Discourage new temporary settlement formation for mining or large-
scale construction projects, e.g. the building of a solar-plant) by
facilitating housing-provision in closest existing regional
development anchors and/or regional service towns and support
with public transport.

5.7.8 National Risk of Non-Action

The NSDF seeks to fundamentally and decisively change and transform
South Africa from a country shackled by its past, into a truly free and just
country that offers a (1) decent quality of life, and (2) a fair chance to
make a life, to all who live in it. To this effect it puts forward a series of
proposals to bring this transition about, and identified the set of NSAAs,
as briefly described in Section 5.7.6. Yet, it may be that there is a
reluctance, slowness or unwillingness to implement the proposals. The
table below (Table 31) sets out the risks associated with failure to act in
and on the NSAAs.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019 WFP.
 Table 31: Risks of Non-Action in/on the NSAAs

HIGH RISKS OF NON-ACTION IN/ON

  

STRATEGIC ACTION AREAS

Lack of development management in
national ecological and biodiversity
management areas, such as the
Natural Resource Risk Areas and the
National Transformation Corridors

   

Unmanaged urban growth land-use resource risk areas and transformation corridors with resultant
negative impacts on (1) sensitive ecological infrastructure, (2) the tourism sector, and (3) other economic
opportunities of national significance.

‘Running out of water’, which will have detrimental effects on (1) all inhabitants dependant on these
urban regions, but notably so vulnerable communities, (2) job creation, (3) agriculture and food
production, and (4) living costs.

Continued settlement development infiltrating high-value agriculture and strategic national surface
water production areas.

Due to the population size and scale of settlement in national urban regions, massive losses of biodiversity
and crucial ecosystems services for urban regions, the country at large, and the globe.

 

Lack of action in areas were land-use
and water bodies and production are in
competition

Will most likely cause severe risks to stressed catchments in fulfilling their roles, and place downstream
dependent regions at risk.

Could lead to costly pollution and life-threatening toxicity of water bodies and streams with a resultant
threat to human, plant and animal life and enormous financial expenses to resolve the matter.

Failure to manage competitive land use between human settlements, water production and food
production can result in food and water shortages.

 

Failure to maintain and improve
international trade and movement
infrastructure (routes and ports)

A loss in South Africa’s competitive advantage with regards to infrastructure.
Restricting growth and limiting national, SADC, African and global integration.
An increased burden on road networks if the rail network is not attended to.

 

Failure to improve and extend critical
infrastructure and develop the three
National Transformation Corridors

 

 

Increased sprawl, loss of high-value agricultural land, loss of surface water production areas, an increase
in joblessness and growing frustration and associated risks to national cohesion and stability.

A squandering of a real opportunity to turn around the dreadful spatial, social and economic legacies
of Apartheid in what includes large swaths of former Bantustan areas.

HIGH RISKS OF NON-ACTION IN/ON
STRATEGIC ACTION AREAS

Lack of future-orientated, nationally

directed urban growth in areas of

RESULTANT IMPLICATIONS

Urban and settlement growth merely following existing trends (as illustrated through spatial modelling of
most likely trends without intervention), which will severely reduce our ability to (1) create viable
livelinoods at scale, (2) threaten our natural resources, and (3) reduce government's ability to provide
sustainable services in towns.

The legacies of the colonial and Apartheid pasts will become even more deeply entrenched across the
national urban-rural landscape.

Towns in arid areas with unfavourable climate conditions will become ever-more exposed to risks that
they will most likely not be able to counter or manage.

 

Ineffective governance, funding
shortfalls in the provision of municipal
infrastructure, and a lack of a nationally
targeted, systematic, systemic and
long-term developmental focus on
large urban areas, towns and national
development corridors with large urban
concentrations

 

A loss of the opportunity to harness the ‘triple dividend’ of a youthful population, many of whom are
located in urban areas.

A serious likelinood of unmanaged urban growth and land-use in coastal areas with devastating effects
on (1) sensitive ecological infrastructure, and (2) related tourism and economic activities and
opportunities.

An increasing inability of even large municipalities to meet the growing demands of a fast-growing
population, and provide services and sustain environments in which economies can take root and grow,
leading to (1) outbreaks of disease with associated chronic public health risks, (2) business closures, (3)
more unemployment and more crime, (5) a loss in the quality of life in urban areas, (6) massive social
unrest and an increase in xenophobic attacks and violence, (7) the collapse of the Rand and the large-
scale departure of local and foreign investors, and (8) the mass emigration of millions of especially young
South Africans.

PART SIX: Implementation Framework

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 
 6.1. Introduction

The implementation framework outlines the measures, approach and
actions required to realising our National Spatial Development Vision in a
coherent, diligent and systematic way.

The NSDF is aimed at addressing our history of forced removals, spatial
segregation and unequal spatial investment. This legacy of colonialism
and Apartheid persists to this day, and leads to the perpetuation of
inequality, unemployment and poverty. The Apartheid National Spatial
Development Logic underpinning this legacy has to be disrupted and
undone, to enable us to bring about a very different future.

Despite much progress having been made since 1994 in (1) the provision
of basic services, (2) housing delivery, and (3) integrated development
legislation, policy and planning, the unequal spatial development
patterns have continued. We have failed to bring about spatial
transformation, i.e. moving from a segregated, unequal and inefficient
Apartheid National Spatial Development Pattern to a new, integrated,
inclusive and sustainable Ideal National Spatial Development Pattern.

The major gap in our transformation effort has been at a strategic spatial
investment and implementation level, where, despite a sound National
Development Paradigm including the Constitution, the NDP and a
progressive legal and policy framework, we have not been able to
disrupt and overcome colonial and apartheid spatial development
logics in practice.

The NDP recognises that it is only through radical and decisive

intervention that is coherently planned for and managed in the national
sphere at the national scale, that we stand a chance of disrupting the

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

apartheid spatial logic and space economy, and overcoming the
inequities and distances brought about by colonialism and Apartheid.

The NSDF has been prepared to give effect to the NDP by providing
national spatial development guidance and direction. As such, the NSDF
is closing the gap in our transformation effort by changing and
influencing practice by becoming clearer about (1) the strategic spatial
development challenges and opportunities across the country, and (2)
the desired National Spatial Development Outcomes.

The NSDF's analysis of National Spatial Development Shapers indicates
the five key problems emanating from the current national spatial
development pattern that the country has to address:

e High pressure on natural resources;

e Inequitable use of land;

e High rates of urbanisation with high pressure and expectations of
adequate housing, basic services and jobs;

e High levels of poverty in the former Bantustan and township areas;
and

e A’ disconnected national spatial pattern where there is mis-
alignment between where economic activity takes place and
where people live, where natural resources are located, and
costly infrastructure networks is in place.

The NSDF’s theory of change presents the pathway from the current
situation to the desired spatial future, and the NSDF by:

e Crafting a strong and credible and Post-Apartheid National
Spatial Development Vision;

e Articulating a compelling and persuasive Post-Apartheid Spatial
Development Logic;

183
 e Crafting a desired Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development
Pattern;

e Setting out interventions and actions that are required to bring
about the desired Post-Apartheid National Spatial Development
Pattern; and

e Providing Implementation Guidance for realising the desired
national spatial transformation.

As such, and it being positioned alongside and in tandem with the NDP,
the NSDF, once adopted by Cabinet, will be the Apex Spatial Plan for the
country, and it will remain so until it is reviewed in the future. This means
that henceforth all spatial plans, investment and projects in the country
have to give effect to achieving the NSDF intent and adhere to the NSDF
Frames and Guidelines.

In order to transcend the “practice gap”, there will be a rigorous focus
on holding all three spheres of government, sector departments and
social actors accountable for their (1) planning, (2) investment decisions
and (3) delivery programmes, according to the extent to which these
processes advance the objectives of the NDP and the NSDF, and adhere
to the spatial development guidance and directives of the NSDF.

6.2 Preparing for Success

The successful implementation of the NSDF is dependent on all role
players within and outside of government understanding the spatial
guidance and directives, and interpreting, advancing, applying and
adhering to these.

The scale of spatial change identified over the 2050-horizon as well as the
limited window of opportunity to realise the demographic and urban

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

dividend, means that there has to be an acceleration towards the
desired spatial future pathway and outcomes. This will require (1) a
renewed vigour, belief and urgency, (2) a posture of excellence and
country success, and (3) retooled and even new capabilities to build an
inclusive and prosperous society in a far more focused and methodical
manner.

The NSDF guides and promotes coordinated work across government
and society where every national department, state entity, province,
municipality, civil society organisation, private sector, and the public has
to:

e Be aware of and appreciate the national spatial transformation
imperative of the country;

e Understand and promote the National Spatial Development
Vision 2050, and commit to realising the vision; and

e Be accountable for the spatial impact of planning, investment
and actions as they relate to achieving the Ideal National Spatial
Development Pattern and the spatial transformation of places.

The state will lead the process under the framework of the NDP by
ensuring a cohesive government approach with the NSDF sitting
complementarily to the NDP at the apex of the country’s spatial
development planning system. The implementation of the NSDF operates
as such within the constitutional framework of the country, as well as
within the precepts of the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act,
2005, with regards to coordinating the implementation of national
priorities, and in furthering the objectives set out in SPLUMA, in particular:

e The NSDF has to indicate the desired patterns of land use in the
country and guide and direct provincial and municipal SDFs
accordingly; and

184
 e The NSDF has to guide planning and development across alll
sectors of the national sohere of government, and contribute to
a coherent planned approach to spatial development in the
three spheres of government.

Implementation of the NSDF entails the process of adapting and
improving the process of development planning across government and
ensuring that it informs government (corporate/departmental) planning,
budgeting (investment), delivery and enforcement — (spatial
governance}, to achieve the desired national spatial development
outcomes.

The NDP-NSDF at the apex of the country’s development planning system
informs the government (or corporate/organizational) planning cycle.
The development plans (sector strategies, provincial growth and
development strategies and provincial spatial development frameworks,
municipal integrated development plans and spatial development
frameworks) are strategic, integrated and/or sector-wide long-term
plans, whilst the corporate plans are short-medium term departmental
plans (national, provincial and municipal) linked to the Medium Term
Strategic Framework (MTSF) and the annual and three-year multi-year
budgeting (MTEF) cycle.

The successful implementation of the NSDF will require additional and
more appropriate capacity to be developed across government for this
approach to long-term strategic planning, investment have a positive
spatial development impact on delivery. All departments, state entities,
provinces and municipalities will have to (1) retool existing capabilities,
and (2) find, or augment capacity for the new task at hand, working
together with industry, tertiary institutions and professional bodies.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

This must also be an opportunity to tap into the agility and resourcefulness
of young planners and nurture and fast-track young talented planners
who have the passion and drive for making a better future.

6.3 Work Streams

The implementation of the NSDF refers to what in essence are four
processes running in parallel and these are accordingly arranged into
four interrelated work streams, i.e.:

e Workstream 1: Championing and Support;

e Workstream 2: Development Planning Alignment;

e Workstream 3: Investment Spending Alignment; and
e Workstream 4: Spatial Development Accountability.

Workstream 1: Championing and Support

This workstream pertains to the custodianship of the NSDF and the
process of ensuring that the NSDF is being advanced and institutionalised
within government and across society.

A dedicated Spatial Transformation Unit in national government with the
necessary resources and authority will be responsible for the following:

Embedding the NSDF in government and across society:

e Championing and guiding NSDF implementation;

e Undertaking broad-based communication of the NSDF to build
shared understanding;

e — Institutionalisation of the NSDF into Centre of Government Planning,
Budgeting, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Systems;

185
 Undertaking ongoing spatial development observation and
research;

Embedding collaborative planning and action ;

Undertaking ongoing engagement spatial develooment norms,
standards and differentiated guidelines for different integrated,
inclusive and sustainable settlement formations;

Providing technical support to departments, provinces, and
municipalities in interpreting and applying the NSDF Frames and
guidelines; and

Reviewing and updating the NSDF.

Engaging in review of policy and fiscal tools and instruments that support
and incentivize spatial transformation:

Evaluating performance of fiscal instruments in relation to spatial
transformation outcomes;

Reviewing investment requirements, fiscal capacity, funding and
financing strategies;

Reviewing infrastructure and human settlement grant funding
mechanisms;

Undertaking socio-economic cost-benefit modelling; and

Making recommendations with regard to the establishment of any
special Spatial Funds.

Supporting coordination of spatial transformation and national priority
actions:

The NSDF will apply all at once across the country where the different
role players have to exercise their mandates and perform their
functions according to the spatial guidance and direction detailed
in the NSDF Sub-Frames. There will have to be a focus on national

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

priority issues and actions, i.e. the NSAAs, and these will be supported
at a central coordinating level in a focused and phased manner;
The Spatial Transformation Unit could sequence and support intensive
focus and coordination of national sector strategies and plans in
each urban and rural region and corridor for defined periods until all
regions are spatially transformed between now and 2050; and
Similarly, in alignment with the NSDF and in coordination with the
national spatial transformation unit, each Province will prepare or
refine/adapt their PSDF and will undertake coordination at provincial
level, to identify and sequence focal areas within the province.

Workstream 2: Development Planning Alignment

This workstream entails the process by which sector departments,
provinces and municipalities prepare their sector strategies, spatial and
development plans. These plans have to be reviewed and aligned with
the NSDF.

Each national department, state entity, province and municipality
already has a mandate and set of responsibilities in terms of planning,
implementation and spatial governance. These roles will continue, but
they will now have to be undertaken in adherence with the NSDF.

The priority for each role player will be:

e National sector departments have to prepare or review their sector
strategies as long-term plans that respond/align to the broader
development goals and objectives set out in the NDP and the
spatial development objectives and outcomes set out in the NSDF;

e The key priority sector issues and strategies will have to focus on:

o Long-term water security for all, according to the desired
future national spatial development pattern;

186
 oO

Energy security for all according to the desired future national
spatial development pattern;

The provision of social services (schools, clinics, hospitals,
community centres, sports fields, etc) to meet growth
demands and according to the desired future spatial
development pattern;

Protection of high value agricultural land, surface water and
biodiversity areas;

Providing guidance as to where future settlement growth may
take place, according to the desired future national spatial
development pattern, and limiting the footprint of land
development and human settlement in the process;
Developing economic development strategy, highlighting
the role, potential, opportunities and unique selling points
across different places;

The justification, spatial impacts and place-making logics of
new economic nodes (SEZs, mines, industrial parks,
commercial hubs) and economic infrastructure investment
including roads, ports, rail, and telecommunications;
Rehabilitation of mining land in declining mining areas and
diversification of local economies;

Guiding and resolving conflicting land uses according to the
NSDF guidelines and by undertaking research and obtaining
independent inputs and recommendations;

Initiating well-considered rural development strategies and
rural economic diversification and industrialization; and
Working together with traditional leaders, preparing a
framework for, and ensuring agreement on undertaking
settlement planning and unlocking land development in
areas under traditional authority control.

Provinces have to:

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

o Prepare or review their PGDSs and PSDFs and align these with
the NSDF;

o Coordinate the alignment of provincial sector and municipal
plans and demonstrate how this alignment is contributing to
the adherence of the NSDF; and

o Change provincial soending patterns according to desired
spatial impact, especially human settlement subsidies.

e Similarly, municipalities have to:

o Prepare or review their IDPs and SDFs for their area of
jurisdiction according to the spatial guidance and direction
provided in the NSDF, and in alignment with the respective
province; and

o Conduct spatial governance, undertake their spatial
planning and land use management functions, more
rigorously and in strict adherence with spatial transformation
and inclusive place-making objectives as outlined in the
NSDF.

e The private sector has to:

o Undertake investment and prepare development
applications in accordance with the NSDF spatial guidance;
and

o Adhere to the SDF of the respective municipalities, and not
undermine municipalities and/or act in any manner that
compromises the shift to an efficient and inclusive spatial
forms.

Workstream 3: Investment Spending Alignment

This workstream entails the process by which departments, state entities,
provinces and municipalities undertake their budgeting and
implementation processes. These processes have to be aligned to the
NSDF.

187
 National Treasury (NT) will have to consider the alignment with the
NSDF in the allocation and approval of budgets. A joint
committee between the Spatial Transformation Unit and NT will
consider infrastructure investment spending proposals and large-
scale projects will have to undergo spatial impact assessment
prior to any approvals.

Workstream 4: National Spatial Development Accountability

A special spatial impact monitoring and reporting unit will be
established to set up and operate a_ national spatial
accountability system. This will entail coordinating the reporting
by the various departments, state entities, provinces,
municipalities and private sector in relation to adherence to the
spatial guidance and direction set out in the NSDF and in relation
to the performance of their own functions and performance
against any specific/relevant actions identified in the NSDF.

Whereas in the past, role players were not sufficiently held to
account for the spatial impact of their planning, investing and
delivery processes, now each of the role players including private
sector as part of the national spatial accountability system will be
more rigorously engaged and will be obligated to report on how
they are adhering/contributing or not through the performance
of their own functions to the desired spatial development
patterns and outcomes.

The unit will establish criteria based on the NSDF Frames in
assessing the planning and investment of role players and will
prepare and submit reports on annual basis to cabinet to identify

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

gaps and make proposals on improving alignment and
adherence to the NSDF.

Workstream 1 will oversee and provide support for the alignment
processes undertaken in workstreams 2 and 3. Workstream 4 will
monitor the alignment and impacts of work undertaken in
workstreams 2 and 3 (see Figure 66).

 6.4 Rolling out the NSDF

For the NSDF vision and goals to be achieved, along with the desired
national spatial transformation, there are enabling activities, institutional
mechanisms and capability enhancements that need to be considered
for the national planning system to operate. As argued in a recent DPME
report, “The imperative for institutionalisation is derived from identified
gaps and the need to build the planning system by introducing a stronger
and explicit developmental focus. In this context, institutionalisation
means developing and strengthening the institutional, technical and
administrative foundations (capacities, systems and processes) for a
coordinated and responsive state that would be effective in promoting
the structural changes required for inclusive growth, developing the
country’s human resource base and a stronger democracy”. Capability
enhancements to the spatial planning system include building spatial
literacy within government and enhancing the coordination and
alignment roles traditionally played by spatial planners in
intergovernmental systems.

Given that the capability of the state is a key enabler of effective
planning, governance and implementation, the implementation of the
NSDF (1) is intrinsically tied to government's institutional, organisational
and individual capabilities, and (2) rests on two interrelated components:

e The use and application of the NSDF to guide action and spatial
investment; and

e The building of ‘national spatial planning and transformation capability’
to undertake, manage and develop the benefits of spatial planning
at an_ institutional, organisational and individual level within
government and more broadly, across society.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

The promulgation of SPLUMA has clarified the role of spatial planning and
land-use management. At the same time, the systems and frameworks
for intergovernmental planning and budgeting are being institutionalised
and improved. Implementation, like planning, is, however, not a once-off
step. In the case of the NSDF, it is also a continuous process of mobilising
resources and action, guided by the objectives and desired outcomes of
the NDP. Improvements and refinements are also made through
monitoring and review, to (1) improve approaches and understandings,
and (2) overcome obstacles on a continuous basis.

The NSDF has identified five areas for action that need to be considered.
These consist of three enabling components and two change and
transformation-driving components.

The three enabling components are:

e A championing capability, with associated programmes for
building spatial transformation capability and supporting
behaviour change;

e Supporting the ‘centre of government’ institutions in improving
developmental outcomes through the system of planning,
budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; and

e Guiding the alignment and coordination of investment spending
and planning capacity development, both (1) within
government spheres and sectors, and (2) through broader
private sector, civil society and learning organisation support and
involvement.

The two change and transformation-driving components are:

e Communicating and sharing the NSDF, to ensure that it is broadly
understood, and its use is enabled; and

190
 e Specific and priority spatially targeted initiatives that (1) are of
national significance, and (2) draw from the core components of the
NSDF, as set out in Part Five

The five action areas would, taken as a whole, enable the NSDF and
national spatial planning to be:

e Championed: National spatial planning is championed, researched
and continually refined and developed, and national spatial planning
capability and support systems are built across society, to ensure the
desired national spatial development patterns and outcomes;

e Communicated: The NSDF is broadly shared to ensure awareness and
buy-in across society;

e — Institutionalised in centre of government systems: National spatial
planning (1) supports and responds to the developmental agenda of
the state, as articulated in the NDP, and (2) is articulated through key
national planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation systems;

e Embedded: The NSDF is well-understood and actors can (1) respond
to it, and (2) utilize it to guide and coordinate investment to transform
space through provincial, regional and municipal SDFs and sector

plans; and
e Actioned: Strategic spatial initiatives and priorities within the NSDF are
acted upon and implemented (1) in a systemic way, and (2) by

appropriate champions and role-players who have a direct
mandate relating to each priority.

Each of these aspects is discussed in more detail below:

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

6.4.1 Objective One: Championing and Guiding NSDF
Implementation

A key capability is a national institutional home for spatial planning and
spatial transformation. As a matter of urgency there is a need to resolve
the issue of ‘the home of spatial planning nationally’. Consideration should
also be given to establishing a dedicated ‘unit’, staffed with the necessary
technical and administrative expertise. The aim of this Unit would be to:

e Provide advice and guidance on how to maximise spatial impacts
and transformation across government;

e Actively coordinate across government for better spatial outcomes;

e Report on implementation of the NSDF, and the extent to which
outcomes are achieved; and

e Build spatial literacy within government and strengthen the capacity
and capability of planners and the spatial planning system.

Three functions would be important, amongst others. First, to work across
government to align spatial action to the NSDF and support spatial
transformation more broadly. This would be both at the strategic levels of
the MTSP/MTSF and MTEF and other associated centre of government
coordinating mechanisms and through national sector, provincial and
local planning. Second, to champion research into, and around spatial
planning and improving its utility to government. This could include
working with learning organisations, civil society and other bodies to
improve spatial planning capability. Third, to, through a consultative
process, develop a framework for monitoring and evaluating the
efficacy and realisation of spatial transformation, and in particular
focusing on the priority actions associated with the NSDF frames.

To facilitate this role, it is proposed that consideration be given to
establishing two supporting structures. Firstly, a ‘National Spatial

191
 Transformation Working Group’ chaired by a/the lead spatial planning
department. The aim of this working group would be to coordinate
national action around spatial transformation. Second, a ‘National
Spatial Transformation Committee’. This advisory and support committee
should comprise representatives of the three spheres of government, the
private sector, academia and professional bodies. Although drawing on
the NSDF, this committee would have a broader focus and be composed
with the aim of informing the spatial transformation agenda of
government and society. Given the important role of evidence,
monitoring and knowledge-sharing, this capacity needs to be enabled.
As such, it could also guide the building and deepening of ‘spatial
literacy’ and spatial planning capabilities amongst the built environment
professions and within government.

The detailed terms of reference for the proposed Unit, Working Group
and Committee would have to be developed while taking cognisance
of existing structures and current processes, to avoid duplication and to
ensure alignment, e.g. with the IUDF Working Group.

A priority for the proposed Unit, should be to engage in discussions with
National Treasury on the development of a fund under the jurisdiction of
the Unit to support transformation objectives. The scope of the fund
would need to be developed in consultation, but aspects could include
those relating to supporting spatial transformation initiatives of national
significance (especially around coordination and alignment in space
and time), spatial planning and transformation

6.4.2 Objective Two: Communication of Shared Action

Communication is an essential and often neglected aspect of
implementation. It is also a cost-effective way of building understanding
and shared action. People and institutions can only act on, and invest in,
a plan they know and understand. An effective communication strategy

192
 that targets all soheres of government, the private sector, academia and
civil society will have to be put into place. The proposed Spatial
Transformation Unit should be tasked with developing and implementing
this, and the requisite funding provided.

This communications strategy would need to work across a range of
platforms. Consideration should be given to professional communications
support, to develop and, as and where necessary, implement certain
components of the communications strategy. Two key components
should be included in such a strategy:

e A strong web-presence and profiling on key government websites,
and in particular, ‘centre of government departments’, which
includes The Presidency, DPME, COGTA, DRDLR, and NT; and

e The use of existing inter-governmental engagement platforms to
profile and explain the NSDF, including key government partners,
such as SALGA, who would be a crucial ally in introducing and
communicating the NSDF to municipalities.

6.4.3 Objective Three: Institutionalisation of the NSDF into
Centre of Government Planning, Budgeting,
Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation System

Consideration needs to be given astohow the NSDF will link to the broader

systems of planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and

evaluation in government. Thisincludes discussion as to how the NSDF

could, amongst others:

e Support and strengthen the proposed Medium-Term Strategic Plan
(MTSP) and the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF);

e Inform and help strengthen the ‘Budget Mandate Paper’;

e Improve alignment of sector and sphere budgeting, especially as
related to spatially-targeted capital spending (and long-term

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

infrastructure spending in particular);

e Contribute, through its implementation processes, to capacity
building that impacts and supports spatial transformation; and

e Assist in identifying where special grants or other funding mechanisms
could be considered to support spatial targeting, regional planning
and other programmes aimed at spatial transformation

 Suggestions for discussion include:

 

DPME utilizes the NSDF to provide the spatial lens to the Medium-
Term Strategic Plan (MTSP).

In line with the above, the DPME utilizes the NSDF as the spatial
representation of the Mandate Paper (annually) prioritization and
the MTSF (five-year cycle).

That DPME monitors the alignment of sector budget spending in
physical space in line with the NSDF.

National Treasury

In recognising the role of the NSDF in coordinating spending in
space, NT could consider ways to use it to guide national sector
department budgets (especially long- term infrastructure) and
check that programmes align to and reinforce the objectives of
the NSDF.

That this soending and prioritization is monitored and reported on.

COGTA

That CoGTA supports the developmental, place-based and
regional approach of the NSDF through capability- building and
other related initiatives. This approach could take the form of

 

 

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

 

regional intervention starting with PGDSs and PSDFs (and possibly
associated RSDFs).

 

 

e That DRDLR (or the department responsible for spatial planning)
establish a well-resourced and capacitated Spatial Planning
Support Agency (or similar) that sees to, and if necessary, funds the
placement of accredited spatial planners in every municipality.

e That DRDLR (or the department responsible for spatial planning)
considers how to empower planners and support them in building
and enabling cross-sphere alignment with spatial planning.

 

Figure 69 below illustrates conceptually the interface of the NSDF with the
national system of planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring
as discussed above and in the following section. Milestones of the
implementation and monitoring system are as follows:

194

2) Sector department

3) Sector department

195
 1.) Five-year national planning cycle: After a national election a five-year
plan of action is developed. Given the status of the NDP, this draws from
the NDP, a shared plan. This plan is used to inform the MTSF of government
as a whole. The NSDF is aligned to the NDP and is likewise reviewed every
five years. It must also find expression in the MTSP. Annually the Mandate
Paper identifies key priorities, likewise, there should be spatial investment
priorities identified drawing on the MTSP.

2.) Three-to-five-year actions: Taking their cue from the MTSF and NDP,
sector departments and municipalities formulate their strategic plans
(three-five years) and National Treasury developments the budget and
MTEF to the same logic. National sector departments and municipalities
must then utilise the NSDF to develop their own spatial depiction of their
strategic plans and link these to their budgets (the spatial investment
components).

3.) Annual actions: Annual performance plans and budgets then need
to set targets for each against the long-term strategic plan.

National Spatial Development Framework Draft 2019

6.4.4 Objective Four: Embedding Implementation and
Collaborative Action

All government departments preparing sector plans need to consider
their spatial impact, especially as related to capital and infrastructure
spending, and such plans must be aligned with the spatial priorities
outlined in the NSDF. The aim is to achieve crucial urban, rural, municipal,
provincial, regional and national development goals and objectives. This
discussion needs to be focused on the procedures to facilitate and
promote cooperative government and intergovernmental relations in
respect of spatial development planning.

This aspect needs to explore the way in which this is done through:

e National sector departments;

e Provincial government plans;

e Municipal planning;

e Sub-national or regional planning;
e The private sector;

e Civil society; and

e Learning organisations.

196
 Suggestions for discussion include:

It is suggested that national sector departments and
their provincial counterparts add a spatial component
to their strategic plans that (1) is aligned to the NSDF,
and (2) depicts the location of their spending,
especially those components with a specific spatial
and/or capital/infrastructure expenditure component.
In doing so, they should also indicate how they will
engage with the unique attributes of the places where
the investment will ‘land’ in a sub-national space in
such manner that it (1) responds to the unique regional
and local challenges (as articulated in the IDP and
SDFs), and (2) supports regional and local

development in the area concerned.

System (SEAIS) is required. The suggestion is that an
indicative capital expenditure spatial framework be
incorporated as part of the Socio-Economic Impact
Assessment System (SEAIS).

That Provincial Governments explore practical ways of
utilizing the NSDF as an important contextual frame for
the preparation of their PGDSs and PSDFs.

The NSDF could identify, make use of and coordinate
relevant regional collaboration, and/or spatial
development planning initiatives. Recent examples
are the Nama Karoo and the Northern Free-State
Regional Initiatives, and associated RSDF processes.

That consideration be given by municipalities to
practically using the NSDF as a ‘crucial frame’ in the
preparation and review of their IDPs and SDFs, and any
other form of long-term strategic planning.

That citizens, civil society organisations and the private
sector are encouraged to engage proactively and on
a continuous base with the NSDF, to ensure that their
investment and spending decisions (1) respond to,
and support national, regional and local needs, and

(2) actively contribute to national — spatial
transformation and inclusive economic growth.
Capacity building on national (1) trends, dynamics,

challenges and opportunities, (2) sense-making, and
(3) spatial development concepts and plans is
important. Learning institutions are encouraged to

6.4.5 Objective Five: Sector Specific and Spatially Targeted
Priorities Actioned

This objective is the most important for spatial transformation. All the
preceding objectives ultimately need to focus on the sector specific and
spatially-targeted priorities identified in the NSDF’s Frame and Sub-
Frames.

The NSDF seeks to support improved investment impact and alignment
of (1) national integrated and sector plans, and (2) provincial and
regional plans and strategies within the context of government's five-
year planning and review cycle and process. As indicated in Figure 70
below, this it does by (1) being informed, and taking its cue from the NDP
and a myriad of other multi-term, multi-sector, multi-sohere spatial-
decision-making processes and plans, frameworks, strategies and
programmes, and in turn (2) guiding many of these, and a range of other
such plans, frameworks, strategies and programmes when they are being
prepared, implemented and/or reviewed.
