Definitions1
Term Definition
Adaptation The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human 
systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial 
opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate 
adjustment to expected climate and its effects.
Adaptive capacity The ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to 
potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to 
consequences.
Climate change Refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using 
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and 
that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change 
may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, such as modulations 
of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the 
composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
Climate-smart 
agriculture
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to 
transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and 
ensure food security in changing climate. CSA aims to tackle three main objectives: 
sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, adapting and building 
resilience to climate change, and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas 
emissions, where possible. 
Ecological 
infrastructure
Ecological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver 
valuable services to people, such as water and climate regulation, soil formation and 
disaster risk reduction (SANBI 2019a)
Ecosystems An ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living 
environment and the interactions within and between them. The components 
included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for 
which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in 
others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems 
are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to the 
entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key 
organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment.
Ecosystem-based 
adaptation 
Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystems to 
support communities to adapt to life in a less predictable climate system (SANBI 
2019b)
Environment The surroundings within which humans exist and that are made up of i) the land, 
water and atmosphere of the earth; ii) micro-organisms, plant and animal life; iii) 
any part or combination of i) and ii) and the interrelationships among and between 
them; and iv) the physical, chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and

conditions of the foregoing that influence human health and well-being. (Republic 
of South Africa 1998)
Gini coefficient The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some 
cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an 
economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution (OECD 2006)
Greenhouse gas The gaseous constituents of the global atmosphere, both
natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re -emit infrared radiation.
Mitigation A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs). This report also assesses human interventions to reduce the sources 
of other substances which may contribute directly or indirectly to limiting climate 
change, including, for example, the reduction of particulate matter emissions that 
can directly alter the radiation balance (e.g., black carbon) or measures that control 
emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, Volatile Organic Compounds and 
other pollutants that can alter the concentration of tropospheric ozone which has 
an indirect effect on the climate.
Natural capital Natural capital are natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs 
and environmental services for economic production (OECD 2005).
Representative 
Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs)
Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite 
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as 
land use/landcover. The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only 
one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing 
characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes the fact that not only the long-term 
concentration levels but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome 
are of interest. 
Resilience The ability of a social, economic or ecological system to absorb disturbances while 
retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for selforganisation and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.
Sustainability A dynamic process that guarantees the persistence of natural and human systems in 
an equitable manner.
Sustainable 
Development
The integration of social, economic and environmental factors into planning, 
implementation and decision-making so as to ensure that development serves 
present and future generations(Republic of South Africa 1998).
Transformative 
Change
A system-wide change that requires more than technological change through 
consideration of social and economic factors that, with technology, can bring about 
rapid change at scale.
Vulnerability The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability 
encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or 
susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.5

1. Introduction
South Africa is experiencing significant effects of climate change particularly as a result of increased 
temperatures and rainfall variability. The observed rate of warming has been 2 C per century or even 
higher – more than twice the global rate of temperature increase for the western parts and the 
northeast (DEA 2017, 72). There is evidence that extreme weather events in South Africa are 
increasing, with heat wave conditions found to be more likely, dry spell durations lengthening slightly 
and rainfall intensity increasing. Climate zones across the country are already shifting, ecosystems and 
landscapes are being degraded, fires are becoming more frequent, and overused natural terrestrial 
and marine systems are under stress(DEA 2017). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), climate change is likely to increase the frequency and 
magnitude of many extreme events and will certainly increase the risk of slow-onset events such as 
sea level rise and drought (IPCC 2013).
Climate change has the potential to redress the gains made on the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) and impede the country’s ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
also poses risks to opportunities for socioeconomic development. There is increasing international 
recognition that strong and sustainable socioeconomic development can reduce vulnerability to 
climate change and ensure resilience (UN 2016; Chaudhury 2017). Despite the advancements that 
have been made in South Africa, there are still many South Africans that live below the poverty line. 
These and other vulnerable groups, including the elderly, sick, children, and disabled, will be affected 
the most by climate change. In terms of gender, women in South Africa are still more vulnerable to 
the impacts of poverty and face different challenges to men in the workplace, in society and at home 
(Commission for Gender Equality n.d.). Climate change is one such challenge that women will 
experience differently to men. 
Adaptation to climate change presents South Africa with an opportunity to transform both the health 
and the economy, to strengthen the social and spatial fabric, and to become more competitive in the 
global marketplace (Segal and Cloete, 2012; Western Cape Government, 2018). However, systemic 
changes are required in order to minimise the impacts of climate change. Technological advancements 
that consider social and economic factors can assist in making these transformative changes. 
The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (NCCAS) provides a common vision of climate 
change adaptation and climate resilience for the country, and outlines priority areas for achieving this 
vision. The NCCAS’s vision draws on South Africa’s National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP)
(DEA 2011), the National Development Plan (NDP) (NPC 2011), the National Strategy for Sustainable 
Development (NSSD) (DEA 2011b), the adaptation commitments included in its Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs), sector adaptation plans, provincial adaptation plans and municipality
adaptation plans. It should be noted that since the NCCAS is specifically focussed on adaptation to 
climate change, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) is dealt with in other policy 
documents. It is however acknowledged that adaptation and mitigation that adaptation action and 
mitigation action impact on one another. In some cases, adaptation and mitigation action are mutually 
supportive and in other cases mitigation action and adaptation action are mutually contradictory. 10
The NCCAS builds upon principles in other pieces of legislation and policy in South Africa, including the 
National Environmental Management Act, the guiding act for environmental issues, and the 
Constitution, particularly Section 24, that speaks to the rights to a safe and healthy environment.
The NCCAS is an important step forward for South Africa, as it: 
● Acts as a common reference point for climate change adaptation efforts in South Africa in the 
short to medium-term2
, providing guidance across all levels of government, sectors, and 
stakeholders affected by climate variability and change.
● Provides a policy instrument in which national climate change adaptation objectives for the 
country can be articulated to provide overarching guidance to all sectors of the economy.
● Facilitates the degree to which development initiatives at different levels of government and 
business integrate and reflect critical climate change adaptation priorities, and thus inform 
resource allocation by the various stakeholders towards climate change resilience.
● Guides stronger coherence and coordination on climate change adaptation activities between 
different institutions and levels of government.
● Supports South Africa in meeting its international obligations by defining the country’s 
vulnerabilities, plans to reduce such vulnerabilities and leverage opportunities, outlining the 
required resources for such action, whilst demonstrating progress on climate change adaptation.
The NCCAS also serves as South Africa’s National Adaptation Plan and fulfils South Africa’s 
commitment to its international obligations as outlined in the Paris Agreement under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The NCCAS will be used as the basis for 
meeting South Africa’s obligations in terms of the adaptation commitments outlined in the NDC. The 
NCCAS is a ten-year plan that will be reviewed every five years.
The NCCAS is divided into sets of strategic objectives, strategic interventions and strategic outcomes 
with associated actions. The document is directed not only at national government departments, but 
speaks to South African society as a whole, including the key relevant sectoral institutions, provincial 
governments and municipalities, and non-governmental entities including the private sector, the 
research community and civil society.
The National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP) identifies the following priority adaptation 
related sectors: water, agriculture and commercial forestry, health, biodiversity and ecosystems, 
human settlements (urban, rural and coastal), and disaster risk reduction and management (DEA
2011a). The NCCAS goes beyond these sectors to include transportation and infrastructure, energy, 
mining, oceans and coast.
It should however be noted that the NCCAS is a national strategy and as such does not go into detail 
of how adaptation will take place in the many sectors impacted by climate change.
 
2 Time frames for the NCCAS are: Short term 1-3 years, Medium term 4-10 years, Long term - More than 10 
years.11
2. Context
The purpose of this chapter is to contextualise the NCCAS within the international climate change 
regime and leverage alignment with South African policies, legislation and other strategic frameworks. 
Furthermore, it highlights the projected climatic changes South Africa is expected to experience and 
some of the key impacts on different sectors. 
2.1. International Context
The 2019 edition of the Global Risk Report by the World Economic Forum highlights environmental 
risks such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, and the failure to respond to climate change 
effectively, as among the top risks to the globe in terms of impact and likelihood (WEF 2019). Climate 
change was ranked first by Global Risks Perception Survey respondents as an “underlying driver of 
developments in the global risks landscape” (WEF 2019, 13). In 2018, a report on global warming was 
released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC 2018). This watershed report 
highlights the urgency of the climate change challenge and states that the current commitments by 
countries across the globe are not enough to prevent an increase of 1.5 degrees in global 
temperatures. It highlights that the situation is worse than previously thought and that an increase in 
1.5 degrees will have a greater impact than was estimated (IPCC 2018). There are a number of global 
agreements and decisions that South Africa has participated in that aim to respond to and prepare for 
the impacts of climate change. 
In particular, South Africa is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) which aims to achieve the ‘stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [human induced] interference 
with the climate system’ (UN 1992, 4). Under the UNFCCC, it is envisaged that: 'Such a level should be 
achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to 
ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a 
sustainable manner’ (UN 1992, 4). The two key Conference of Parties (COPs) to the UNFCCC that 
prioritised the importance of climate change adaptation were COP16 held in Cancun in 2010 and 
COP21 held in Paris in 2015. COP16 resulted in the adoption of the Cancun Adaptation Framework, 
which placed climate change adaptation on the same level of importance as climate change mitigation 
for the first time. It also established the National Adaptation Plan process (UNFCCC 2011, 4–7). The 
Cancun Adaptation Framework laid the foundation for the Paris Agreement, an outcome of COP21. 
The Paris Agreement elevates the importance of climate change adaptation through the 
establishment of a ‘global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience 
and reducing vulnerability to climate change’ and provides extensive guidance on how countries 
should approach adaptation as a priority (UN 2015a, Article 7). As a signatory, South Africa is required 
to compile a set of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which outline the country’s 
contributions to the global goals to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the 
impacts of climate change (UN 2015a, Article 7). South Africa’s goals regarding adaptation outlined in 
its NDC document are:
● Goal 1: Develop a National Adaptation Plan, and begin operationalization as part of 
implementing the NCCRP for the period from 2020 to 2025 and for the period 2025 to 2030;12
● Goal 2: Take into account climate considerations in national development, sub-national and 
sector policy frameworks for the period 2020 to 2030;3
● Goal 3: Build the necessary institutional capacity for climate change response planning and 
implementation for the period 2020 to 2030;
● Goal 4: Develop an early warning, vulnerability and adaptation monitoring system for key 
climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas for the period 2020 to 2030, and reporting in 
terms of the National Adaptation Plan with rolling five-year implementation periods;
● Goal 5: Development of a vulnerability assessment and adaptation needs framework by 2020 
to support a continuous presentation of adaptation needs; and
● Goal 6: Communication of past investments in adaptation for education and awareness as well 
as for international recognition (DEA 2015a, 3-6).
In the same year that the Paris Agreement was signed, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
was adopted, along with a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs support the 
Paris Agreement as climate change is specifically highlighted under SDG 13: ‘Take urgent action to 
combat climate change and its impacts’, and features across many of the other SDGs, because of its 
cross-cutting nature (UN 2015b, Goal 13). SDG 13 specifically mentions targets relating to 
strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity which align directly with the adaptation goal in the 
Paris Agreement (UN 2015b, Goal 13). In addition, The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
2015–2030, adopted on 18 March 2015, notes that climate change is one of the ‘underlying disaster 
risk drivers’, and that climate change can exacerbate the seriousness of a disaster (UNISDR 2015, p10).
Preparing for climate related disaster and building resilience are key priorities in the Sendai 
Framework. 
Another international agreement that contributes to the global climate change adaptation response 
is the decision on Biodiversity and Climate Change that was adopted in 2016 at the Conference of the 
Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Cancun (UNEP 2016, 34). The Decision 
encourages all Parties to take into account the importance of protecting biodiversity, preserving 
ecosystems, and using ecosystem-based approaches, when developing their NDCs. It also encourages 
the integration of ecosystem-based approaches into climate change adaptation, mitigation, disaster 
risk reduction and other strategic plans (UNEP 2016, 34). Finally, the Global Framework for Climate 
Services was developed to help guide nations, especially those most vulnerable, to prepare and adapt 
to climate change through the development and use of science-based climate information in policy, 
planning and practice (WMO 2016).
2.2. African Context
Africa is likely to experience changes in climate earlier than other regions, and therefore adaptation 
measures are urgently required on the continent (Giordano and Bassini 2019; Besada and 
Sewankambo 2009). Africa’s Adaptation Gap 2: Technical Report (2013) notes that the costs of 
adaptation in Africa could increase to USD 100 billion/year by 2050 in a world that experiences more 
than 4 degrees Celsius warming by 2100. Increased funds from developed countries for adaptation in 
 13
African countries would help to fund these costs. However, finances for adaptation are required from 
continental and national levels as well (UNEP 2015, iv).
The Southern African Development Community’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (CCSAP) 
(SADC 2015) emphasises the need for enhanced climate change adaptation responses in Africa due to 
the wide range of pressing vulnerabilities. The CCSAP aims to coordinate regional and national climate 
change responses in Africa, and to ‘climate proof’ SADC’s policies, strategies and protocols (SADC 
2015).
2.3. National Context 
Although the South African post-apartheid political and policy landscape looks markedly different 
from its apartheid predecessor, the legacy of apartheid is still very evident from a developmental 
vantage point. South Africa remains a dual economy with one of the highest Gini Coefficients in the 
world, perpetuating both inequality and exclusion. The continued social and economic exclusion of 
millions of South Africans, reflected in high levels of poverty and inequality, has been identified as 
South Africa's biggest challenge by the National Planning Commission’s diagnostic report (NPC nd). In 
terms of gender inequality, the report also notes that poverty is higher in woman-headed households 
and that women still continue to earn less than men (NPC nd).
The South African economy is dependent on primary sectors such as agriculture and mining, 
particularly minerals extractives, which are natural resource dependent and energy intensive, with 
energy generation being very important as it is also subject to climate variability and change. 
Therefore, changes in climate are predicted to exacerbate these challenges, as increased 
temperatures, rainfall variability and increased coastal storms and sea level rise will have direct 
impacts on South Africa’s natural resources and infrastructure, affecting food security and health, 
threatening water and coastal resources, and impacting on development. These impacts will be 
especially felt by the poor, as they will be more exposed to them and have fewer resources to cope 
with these impacts. Climate change is therefore predicted to result in further widening of the gap 
between the rich and poor (Ziervogel et al. 2014; Chikulo 2014). Climate change impacts are however, 
already happening in South Africa with increased storms, drought conditions and temperature 
increases being felt across different parts of the country.
The National Development Plan (NDP) of South Africa seeks to eliminate poverty, deliver 
environmental protection and promote economic development by 2030. However, the NDP does not 
test the sensitivity of achieving these goals in light of climate change and variability. Finance set aside 
for development needs to incorporate climate change so that infrastructure and communities are 
resilient to future climate impacts. Furthermore, climate change needs to be mainstreamed into 
budgetary processes in all spheres of government. 
South Africa has, however, made progress in developing a plan that responds to and prepares for the 
impacts of climate change. The National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP), published in 2011, 
prioritizes both climate change mitigation and adaptation in moving towards a climate-resilient and 
lower-carbon economy and society (DEA 2011). The overarching approach to adaptation, as identified 
in the NCCRP, focuses on the development of adaptation responses that are flexible to changing 14
conditions, that take local context and local knowledge into account and that are informed by rigorous 
research. The NCCRP identifies a set of key adaptation related sectors including water, health, human 
settlements, agriculture and commercial forestry, biodiversity and ecosystems, and disaster risk
reduction and management, and advocates the inclusion of climate change into plans for these sectors 
(DEA 2011). Since the development of the NCCRP, considerable progress has been made in developing 
adaptation policies, plans and strategies in various sectors and spheres of government, including the 
development of climate adaptation plans in local and provincial government. 
A sector where significant strides have been made in the integration of climate change adaptation is 
disaster management. The Disaster Management Amendment Act, 2015 (Act No. 16 of 2015), is a 
critical piece of legislation that directly responds to climate change adaptation. The Amendment Act 
assigns responsibility to national, provincial and local spheres of government to invest in disaster risk 
reduction and climate change adaptation interventions for their respective jurisdictions. Each organ 
of state is required to develop disaster management plans that include climate change risks and 
responses.
2.4 Maps
The estimated future water supply vulnerability (2050) for Local Municipalities under a medium 
projected growth scenario. A value of 1 indicates that the water demand and supply of the Local 
Municipality are equal, a value of less than 1 indicates that there is surplus supply and a value of 
more than 1 indicates that either the demand is too high and/or the supply is too low (Cullis and 
Phillips, 2019 in CSIR, 2019).15

medium, high or extreme) based on a combination of the projected increase in very hot days and 
heatwave days (Engelbrecht, Le Roux, Arnold and Malherbe, 2019 in CSIR, 2019).17
The settlements at risk of projected drought tendencies using a risk matrix (low, medium, high or 
extreme) that considered the different values within a drought index and whether they indicate an 
increase or decrease in drought tendencies (Beraki, Le Roux and Ludick, 2019 in CSIR, 2019).
2.5. Climate Change Context
A summary of projected future changes in climate in South Africa are provided in the table below. 
These projections have been taken from the Third National Communication to the UNFCCC (DEA 2017)
and compare projected climate change impacts under high mitigation interventions (Representative 
Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5), and low mitigation interventions (RCP 8.5). RCPs are used to help 
climate researchers and modelers to understand how different mitigation scenarios will impact on 
future concentrations of GHGs. 
Category Projected Climate Changes 
Temperature ● Under low mitigation: temperatures to 
increase drastically. 
○ 2080–2099 period: Temperature 
increases greater than 4 °C across 
South Africa. Increases greater than 
6 °C possible in western, central and 
northern interior. 
● Under high mitigation: 
temperatures in the 
interior could be 
constrained between 2.5 to 
4 °C.18
○ Increases in the number of heat-wave 
days and very hot days. 
●
Rainfall ● More uncertainty in rainfall projections 
than in temperature projections.
● Under low mitigation: 
○ South Africa to experience drier 
conditions overall.
○ Extreme rainfall events to increase 
over the interior.
○
● Under high mitigation: 
Different projections
○ Large number of 
projections predict 
generally wetter 
conditions over the 
central and eastern 
interior.
● Other projections predict 
generally drier conditions.

3. Strategic Focus
This chapter outlines the vision, strategic objectives, strategic interventions and strategic outcomes of 
the NCCAS. 
3.1. Vision
To transition to a climate resilient South Africa, which will follow a sustainable 
development path, guided by anticipation, adaptation and recovery from a changing 
climate and environment to achieve our development aspirations.
3.2. Principles and key elements of adaptation and climate resilience 
The guiding principles for the implementation of the NCCAS are outlined below:
Guiding Principle Description
A country-driven approach The development and implementation of the NCCAS will be driven by South 
Africa and the NCCAS will be coordinated with national sustainable 20
development objectives, plans, policies, programmes.
Based on best available science 
and traditional knowledge
The development and implementation of the NCCAS will be based on best 
available science on observed climate and projected climate changes as 
well as relevant traditional knowledge on climate impacts and potential 
responses.
Participatory, bottom up 
approach
A wide range of stakeholders, including government, communities, civil 
society organisations, research community and private sector actors will be 
involved in the development and implementation of the NCCAS.
People-centred The development and implementation of the NCCAS will place people, their 
needs and their rights at the forefront and serve their physical, 
developmental, cultural and social interests equitably.
Equity The development and implementation of the NCCAS should support and 
promote equity in South Africa.
Gender-responsive The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the 
participation of women, take gender differences in vulnerability to climate 
change into account, address the needs and priorities of both women and 
men and will not exacerbate gender inequalities.
Consideration of vulnerable 
groups
The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the 
participation of vulnerable groups and build resilience and adaptive 
capacity of the most vulnerable people such as women, and especially 
poor and/or rural women; children, especially infants and childheaded families; the aged; the sick; and the physically challenged.
Environmental support for 
climate adaptation
The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the 
protection of ecosystems and biological diversity because of the role they 
play in supporting South Africa's adaptation to climate change.
Address capacity gaps The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the 
development of capacity in climate change adaptation throughout South 
Africa.
Facilitate mainstreaming of 
adaptation
The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the 
integration of adaptation in the policies and planning of sectors as well as 
all three spheres of government.
Continuous, progressive, 
iterative process
The NCCAS will be have a strong Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System 
and further iterations of the NCCAS will be influenced by outcomes of M&E.
Transformative change The implementation of the NCCAS requires transformative change. This 
entails advancements in technology that consider social and economic 
factors that result in system-wide change. 
3.3. Strategic Objectives
As different departments and spheres of government continue to develop and strengthen their own 
comprehensive adaptation strategies, it is critical that they all reflect a shared vision. A common 
reference point is needed to help align ongoing efforts across the country. This document – South 
Africa’s NCCAS – is intended to be the cornerstone for climate change adaptation in the country and 
to reflect a unified, coherent, cross-sectoral, economy-wide approach to climate change adaptation. 21
It outlines priority areas for adaptation, both to guide adaptation efforts and to inform resource 
allocation. The strategic objectives of the NCCAS are as follows:
● Objective 1: Build climate resilience and adaptive capacity to respond to climate change risk 
and vulnerability.

4. Reduce Vulnerability and Build Adaptive Capacity
Reduce human, economic, environment, physical and ecological infrastructure vulnerability and build 
adaptive capacity.
4.1. Introduction
South Africa is already experiencing the negative effects of climate change and is expected to suffer 
significant consequences in the future. To promote adaptation to these impacts it is necessary to take 
measures to reduce human and economic vulnerability as well as to reduce the vulnerability of 
physical and ecological infrastructure to climate change. In addition, it is necessary to build the 
adaptive capacity of individuals and society to respond to climate change impacts. Since vulnerability 
to climate change differs depending on gender, age, wealth, social status and other factors, adaptation 
actions must be targeted in ways that ensure equitable benefits for the individuals and communities 
that are most vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, the contributions of vulnerable groups 
should not be underestimated as their insights and capacities can help to develop actions that are 
most effective. Existing strategies that focus on the inclusion of vulnerable groups should be drawn 
upon, such as DEFF's gender mainstreaming strategy in the environmental sector (DEA 2016c).
Both the Paris Agreement and South Africa’s National Climate Change Response paper highlight the 
importance of adopting an inclusive approach that considers vulnerable groups in climate change 
response(United Nations 2015; DEA 2011a). One of the principles in South Africa’s National Climate 
Change Response paper is to consider those with “special needs and circumstances” that are 
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Those with special needs highlighted include “women, 
and especially poor and/or rural women; children, especially infants and child headed families; the 
aged; the sick; and the physically challenged” (DEA 2011a, 12). A second principle in the NCCRP that 
relates to the vulnerable is “Uplifting the poor and vulnerable”. This principle relates to the need to 
address the needs of vulnerable groups whilst striving for sustainability in response to climate change
(DEA 2011a). Including vulnerable groups in climate change adaptation planning, does not only mean 
considering them, but also including vulnerable groups in decision-making processes, and ensuring 
that they benefit from adaptation actions (NAP Global Network 2019).
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Increased resilience and adaptive capacity achieved 
in human, economic, environment, physical and ecological infrastructure (Strategic Outcome 1.1).
4.2. Status Quo
South Africa has invested in understanding its climate change vulnerabilities since the late 1990s. From 
as early as 1999 a set of reports on climate change vulnerability focusing on certain sectors were 
developed under the programme “'South African Country Reports on Climate Change” (DEA 2018). In 
the early 2000s South Africa developed a national climate change response strategy and some of the 
metropolitan municipalities and provinces started to develop climate change vulnerability and 
adaptation strategies. The NCCRP was then published in 2011 and following that work began on the 
Long Term Adaptation Scenarios documents which provide important information on adaptation (DEA 
2018). Since 2012 DEFF has been running the Lets Respond Toolkit programme, which has helped 
district and local municipalities to develop climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation 
strategies (DEA 2018). 25
There are a wide range of adaptation projects that are currently being implemented in South Africa 
by different stakeholders in different sectors. Some of the existing projects may not be acknowledged 
as ‘climate adaptation projects’ but contribute towards building adaptive capacity and reducing 
vulnerability. Similarly, the adaptation related sectors, that are identified by the NCCRP, are not the 
only sectors to be affected by climate change, and actions in new emerging adaptation related sectors 
are being developed in order to prepare for the impacts of climate change. 
The priority “adaptation” related sectors for South Africa, as identified in the NCCRP, are water, 
agriculture and commercial forestry, health, biodiversity and ecosystems, human settlements (urban, 
rural and coastal), and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DEA 2011a). However, it is becoming 
more apparent that these sectors are not the only ones to be affected by climate change in South 
Africa. New emerging adaptation related sectors include energy, infrastructure (including transport), 
tourism, mining, oceans and coast. In order to ensure that emerging sectors and adaptation actions 
are considered going forward, to reduce vulnerability and build capacity, the NCCAS is adopting a 
cluster approach. The clusters include:
A: Increased human resilience and adaptive capacity
B: Increased economic resilience and adaptive capacity 
C: Increased environment and ecological infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity 
D: Increased physical infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity 
Some of the existing projects in South Africa addressing human resilience and adaptive capacity 
include those that have focused on investigating the complex relationships between climate change, 
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and food security. Improving health care can help to build the resilience of 
communities to better be able to cope with climate change impacts (DEA 2016a). In the economic 
cluster, existing projects include the investment in new technologies such as decentralised energy and 
waste beneficiation. Under the environmental cluster, an effective set of projects that have been 
implemented are the Working for Water, Working for Coast, and Working for Wetlands Programmes 
which involve the removal of invasive alien species and protection of water resources (DEA 2017). 
Under the infrastructure cluster, a range of adaptation projects are being implemented at different 
spheres of government that involve climate-proofing settlements and infrastructure and developing 
local early warning systems for communities. 
Stakeholders that have been key implementers of climate adaptation projects include: government 
actors, provincial stakeholders and municipalities, state entities, non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) and business, among others (DEA 2017). 4.3. Actions
The actions to achieve this outcome are outlined below. It should be noted that this is not an 
exhaustive list. There will also be interdependencies and trade-offs between these actions that will 
need to be explored: In addition the actions in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the 
actions in the mainstreaming chapter. 
Outcome 1.1: Increased resilience and adaptive capacity achieved in human, economic, 
environment, physical and ecological infrastructure 
The actions have been divided up into the four clusters:
A: Increased human resilience and adaptive capacity
B: Increased economic resilience and adaptive capacity

from climate change within 
municipalities and deliver 
targeted climate change 
vulnerability reduction 
programmes for these 
individuals and communities.
This will involve the identification of at-risk individuals (male and 
female) and communities within municipalities. Based on this 
identification targeted vulnerability reduction programmes can be 
designed and delivered, addressing issues such as gender inequality 
and marginalization which represent underlying causes of 
vulnerability to climate change.
1.1.3 Develop a list of resiliencebuilding projects that can 
easily be replicated.
This will involve developing a list of recent successful resiliencebuilding programmes and projects that can easily be replicated in 
other areas or sectors. This action stresses the importance of learning 
from successfully implemented programmes to identify key elements 
that have provided best results in resilience-building in order to 
replicate them in similar environments.
1.1.4 Capacitate and 
operationalise South Africa’s 
National Disaster 
Management Framework to 
strengthen proactive climate 
change adaptive capacity, 
preparedness, response and 
recovery.
This will involve conducting an assessment of gaps and needs with 
regard to the National Disaster Management Framework to identify 
elements of the framework that have not yet been achieved. In 
particular all Disaster Management Centres will need to integrate 
climate change within their terms of reference.27

to manage their resources and provide them with the knowledge on how 
to attain support from government and other social organisations. 
1.1.17 Investigate the potential 
for expanding sectors and 
kick-starting new 
industries that are likely to 
thrive as a direct or 
indirect result of climate 
change effects.
This will involve identifying climate change impacts that will bring about 
new industries and opportunities and then piloting sector specific 
projects with high opportunity potential. The process will kick off with 
the design of these projects and carry through to compiling lessons 
derived from final evaluation of the project.
1.1.18 Educate both informal and 
formal businesses on the 
potential economic 
implications of climate 
change risks and provide 
support on how to better 
prepare for these risks in 
advance. 
This will involve making businesses aware of climate risks and 
encouraging and supporting them to make more informed decisions 
about the future of their businesses. 
1.1.19 Encourage businesses to 
relocate to less hazardous 
areas through incentives

value of ecosystem 
services and the economic 
benefits of restoring these 
services in comparison to 
the development of hard 
infrastructure. 
This will involve research being done on the value of ecosystem services 
and the economic benefits of restoring these services. 
1.1.22 Provide training for the 
public and private sectors 
on the value of ecosystem 
services and the benefits of 
restoring them. 
This will involve educating both public and private sectors of the value 
of ecosystem services and the economic benefits of restoring these 
services.
1.1.23 Protect and conserve 
South Africa’s most 
vulnerable ecosystems, 
landscapes and wildlife, 
and monitor and control 
the spread of alien 
invasives.
This will involve identifying vulnerable ecosystems that need further 
protection from impacts of climate change. Enforced action is required 
against illegal harvesting of coastal and offshore fish stock. Ecosystembased approaches are also recommended to ensure the recovery of 
freshwater and marine fish stocks. Monitoring and controlling alien 
invasive species that benefit from climate change will reduce the risk of 
biodiversity loss
1.1.24 Monitor and control the 
spread of alien invasive 
species that benefit from 
climate change.
This will involve conducting research into identifying the alien invasive 
species that will benefit from climate change and developing responses 
to prevent these species from spreading. Different stakeholders in the 
biodiversity sector need to work together continuously to control the 
spread of these species and minimise the risk of biodiversity loss.
1.1.25 Promote the expansion of 
tree cover, forests and 
forest plantations in order 
to maintain the production 
of wood raw materials, and 
help reduce temperatures 
in cities, amongst other 
benefits.
This will involve identifying stakeholders that can play a role in the 
establishment and increase of tree cover and promotion of wood use in 
local (housing/furniture/other) structures. Other actions will include 
identifying areas where tree planting can occur, identifying suitable tree 
species especially drought resistant species, and long-term planning 
including risk management, and water catchment planning amongst 
others. These activities will ensure equitable benefits for women and 
men, including the most vulnerable groups.
1.1.26 Investigate the potential 
effects of an expanded 
forestry sector on water 
availability.
This will involve conducting research on the potential effects of an 
expanded forestry sector on water availability within the context of 
climate change impacts on water availability.
1.1.27 Support farmers (male and 
female) to use and manage 
water more sustainably.
This will involve the promotion and subsidisation of water conservation 
technologies, taking into account gendered roles and responsibilities in 
relation to water management.

using resilient materials, through 
incentives and tax rebates. 
This will involve the public sector developing guidelines and 
incentives for building infrastructure in low risk areas and using 
climate resilient materials. 
1.1.31 Create a more adaptive energy
system to reduce dependence on 
a centralised system and increase 
distributed generation, especially 
in rural areas.
This will involve encouraging the development of an adaptive 
and decentralised energy system so that the system is more 
resilient to climate disruptions.
1.1.32 Adopt water-wise water 
management practices in urban 
areas
This will involve identifying and adopting suitable water-wise 
water management practices in urban areas such as sustainable 
drainage systems and wastewater treatment systems that are 
able to clean wastewater to a high enough water-quality level 
that it can be re-used.31
5. Climate Services
Develop a coordinated Climate Services system that provides climate products and services for key 
climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas. 
5.1. Introduction
South Africa experiences a wide range of weather and climate related impacts that are projected to 
worsen with climate change. Some of these impacts include drought, severe storms, flooding, heat 
waves, and change in the distribution of disease. These impacts pose risks to human lives, the natural 
environment, infrastructure, and the economy. Different areas, natural systems, sectors, and 
communities will be impacted in different ways, with some being more vulnerable than others. In 
order to prepare for these impacts, it is critical that sound information and data on climate change is 
available and that predictions and forecasts are disseminated so that informed and appropriate 
responses and decisions can be made. The term “Climate Services” (DEA and SAWS 2016, 18) is used 
to encapsulate the different information, data, forecasting and dissemination systems(DEA and SAWS 
2016). The National Framework for Climate Services offers the following explanation of climate 
services: “Climate services offer science based information, weather forecasts, climate predictions and 
climate projections that can empower decision makers to manage the risks and opportunities of 
climate variability and change” (DEA and SAWS 2016).
It is critical that climate services are put in place to provide those sectors, areas, businesses and 
communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, with accurate and timely
information in order to reduce their risk and plan suitable responses. Furthermore, climate 
information should be accessible for all genders and social groups, and barriers to accessing 
information (e.g. literacy and access to technologies) should be considered for different groups. 
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Climate products and services for key climate 
vulnerable sectors and geographic areas developed and implemented (Strategic Outcome 2.1).
5.2. Status Quo
There are several different stakeholders in the climate services space that provide climate information 
and data, modelling and prediction services, as well as dissemination of climate related disasters.
The table below highlights some of the climate products and services that have been developed to 
prepare for different types of climate impacts, including flood, drought, fire, disease, and increased 
heat, as well as the stakeholders involved (DEA 2015b). It should be noted that this is not an exhaustive 
list and does not include existing climate products and services in the private sector.

Recent collaborations between different weather services, emergency services and other 
organisations has resulted in improved climate services, and a subsequent reduction in damage to 
infrastructure and loss of life as a result of climate related disasters (DEA and SAWS 2016). 
In addition, a National Framework for Climate Services has been prepared in response to the Global 
Framework for Climate Services. It aims to provide a framework to better manage climate risks and 
hazards by incorporating climate science and prediction services into planning, policy and practice 
(DEA and SAWS 2016).
5.3. Actions
Although there are a number of climate products and services that have been implemented, there is 
still room for improvement. A network to share information and learnings on climate products and 
services associated technologies would also be particularly useful. It is also important to consider that 
government is not the only stakeholder that should be targeted to communicate climate related 
information and data, and that other stakeholders such as businesses, civil society and communities 
will also benefit from accessing climate information. The following actions to improve South Africa’s 
climate products and services systems are highlighted below.
5.3.1. Climate products and services for key climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas 
developed and implemented
Action Description
2.1.1 Set up a National 
Climate Centre in an existing 
institution
This will involve identifying a suitable institutional home for a 
National Climate Centre. The National Climate Centre should 
coordinate the central collation of climate data, information, 
products and applications, and facilitate climate related research and 
development in South Africa. Since there are a number of existing 
institutions that play an important role in climate services in South 
Africa and already perform some of the functions associated with the 
proposed centre there is no need to establish a new institution.36
Action Description
2.1.2 Establish an Interactive 
Online Climate Service 
Platform
This will involve the development of a specially designed website 
which will act as a climate service knowledge portal. It will present 
information, research and data stored and archived in the national 
climate services database and data from various climate service 
providers. The platform will allow for various users to access sectoral 
climate services on the site or to be directed to service providers who 
can provide customised climate services or products.
2.1.3 Establish a Climate 
Change Science Advisory 
Technical Council
This will involve the establishment of an expert advisory group 
consisting of climate change professionals, climate related sector 
professionals, social scientist professionals from a range of fields, as 
well as science and technology advisors. This group will provide 
advice to the National Climate Centre.
2.1.4 Continue and enhance 
climate observation and 
monitoring networks
This will involve continued investment in and support for capturing 
climate observation and monitoring data. It will also involve 
identifying existing gaps in the monitoring and observation network 
and addressing these gaps to ensure that national climate data is 
reliable, comparable, up to date and accessible.
2.1.5 Continue to invest in 
climate change prediction
and modelling data
This will involve the continued investment in and support for the 
development of climate change predictions and modelling.
2.1.6 Develop and 
continuously update a 
national climate information 
and early warning system to 
address the needs to 
different sectors.
This will involve developing a national climate information and early 
warning system that can interface with other information systems. A 
key component of the system will be methods of disseminating 
information to the stakeholders in an appropriate and timely manner, 
using a variety of different communication channels. It will also 
involve identifying appropriate channels for vulnerable groups to 
overcome the barriers they experience in accessing information
2.1.7 Develop provincial 
early warning systems for 
vulnerable geographical 
areas
This will involve provinces improving or developing early warning 
systems for risks that have been identified in their respective areas, 
particularly for vulnerable groups.
2.1.8 Develop municipal 
early warning systems for 
vulnerable geographical 
areas
This will involve municipalities improving or developing early warning 
systems for risks that have been identified in their respective areas, 
particularly for vulnerable groups.37
Action Description
2.1.9 Improve/develop
national early warning 
systems for key climate 
vulnerable sectors and risks.
This will involve developing/improving early warning systems for key 
sectors, such as agriculture, health, coast, and water, and risks, such 
as flooding, in order to provide guidance on responding to climate 
related risk. For example, agricultural early warning systems could 
include warnings for crop and animal disease. Coastal warning 
systems could include developing platforms that link surfing data with 
real-time warnings for coastal communities. An example of a water 
related early warning system could be a system that focuses on 
warning of hydrological drought so that water restrictions can be 
implemented in advance.
2.1.10 Develop and support 
a climate change early 
warning and vulnerability 
network with the 
involvement of relevant 
stakeholders
This will involve setting up a climate change early warning and 
vulnerability network to promote collaboration and sharing of 
information on preparing for different climate related risks. Role 
players should include government and research institutions, as well 
as community organisations, civil society and neighbouring states.
2.1.11 Investigate 
alternative technologies 
that can be used considering 
the 4th industrial revolution
This will involve researching and investigating appropriate and 
accessible alternative technologies that can be used in developing 
effective and efficient climate services systems, considering new 
technologies as a result of the 4th industrial revolution.
2.1.12 Develop adaptation 
strategies for those that are 
displaced by climate change.
This will involve assisting those displaced by climate change impacts 
to plan for their futures. 38
6. Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Framework
1: Develop vulnerability and resilience methodology framework that integrates biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of vulnerability and resilience.
6.1. Introduction
Sector departments need to identify and map risks and vulnerabilities that are relevant to their sectors
and to use this as a basis to develop a climate change response implementation plan. In addition,
provinces and municipalities should undertake climate change needs and response assessments based 
on the vulnerabilities of the respective provinces and municipalities and use this as a basis to develop 
a climate change response implementation plan.
Accordingly, there is a need to develop a framework to guide sectors, provinces and municipalities on 
the process of undertaking and presenting a vulnerability assessment and the development of climate 
change response implementation plans. This will assist in framing the Climate Risk and Vulnerability 
Assessment process. The framework will support assessment quality and comparability by ensuring 
that government sectors, provinces and municipalities as well as business and civil society take a 
standard set of concepts and themes into consideration when interrogating climate risk and 
vulnerability. Robust understanding thereof will assist in the process of developing appropriate 
responses to climate change that will increase resilience and reduce risk.
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: An adaptation vulnerability and resilience 
framework developed and implemented across 100% of key adaptation sectors (Strategic Outcome 
3.1).
6.2. Status Quo
Climate change vulnerability assessments and associated climate change response plans have been 
developed in South Africa for a number of years by national departments, provinces, municipalities 
and various entities. All the nine provinces in the country have developed risk and vulnerability 
assessments. In the local sphere of government DEFF has supported all district municipalities to 
develop a vulnerability assessment and a climate change response plan. Many local municipalities 
have also conducted their own vulnerability assessments and developed an associated response plan.
Despite the various efforts on vulnerability and response plan development there is no agreed 
vulnerability and resilience methodology framework to provide guidance to this process. As a result,
it is not always possible to compare the results of the assessments or aggregate the results in order to 
provide an overall picture of vulnerability and response across sectors and spheres of government in 
South Africa. 39
6.3. Actions
The actions to achieve this outcome are outlined below:
A Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Framework developed and implemented across 100% 
of key adaptation sectors
Action Description
3.1.1 Develop a 
National Climate Risk 
and Vulnerability 
Assessment 
Framework (NCRVAF)
This will involve developing an overarching adaptation and vulnerability 
resilience framework that provides guidance on the development of 
vulnerability assessments and climate change response plans developed by 
sectors and spheres of government as well as business and civil society. 
Since there is variability among sectors and geographic areas the 
framework should not be prescriptive. Rather it should provide a flexible 
yet structured guidance aimed at ensuring quality of assessments and
improved coherence between assessments and plans, as well as allowing 
for comparisons of the results of the assessments and plans where 
possible. The framework should also provide a platform to assess tradeoffs across sectors so as to further inform sector strategies and plans. The 
process to develop the framework should be done in consultation with 
various sectors, provinces, municipalities, research institutions and other 
relevant entities. The process should also build on work that has already 
been done on developing assessments and response plans.
3.1.2 Use the NCRVAF
to guide sector 
assessments
This will involve sector departments using the NCRVAF as guidance when 
undertaking initial assessments and developing response plans. Sector 
departments should also use the NCRVAF as guidance when reviewing and 
revising existing assessments and response plans.
3.1.3 Use the NCRVAF
to guide provincial 
assessments
This will involve provinces using the NCRVAF as guidance when reviewing 
and revising existing assessments and response plans.
3.1.4 Use the NCRVAF
to guide local 
assessments
This will involve municipalities using the NCRVAF as guidance when 
undertaking initial assessments and developing response plans. 
Municipalities should also use the NCRVAF as guidance when reviewing and 
revising existing assessments and response plans.40
7. Adaptation Planning and Mainstreaming
Strategic Intervention 4: Facilitate mainstreaming of adaptation responses into sectoral planning and 
implementation.
7.1. Introduction 
Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that impacts on different sectors and contexts in different ways. 
Adapting to climate change therefore cannot be limited to the environmental sector and must be 
integrated into planning and implementation processes in different spheres of government, sectors, 
business and civil society. Developing climate change standalone strategies at different levels is 
essential to provide strategic guidance on responding to climate change in South Africa. However, 
these strategies need to be used as a basis to incorporate climate change adaptation into the different 
national sector plans, provincial and municipal plans, and private sector strategic plans, to ensure that 
it will be fully prioritised in these spheres.
The key outcomes for this strategic intervention are:
● Effective adaptation planning that covers at least 100% of the South African sectors identified 
in the NCCAS (Strategic Outcome 4.1)
● Achieving 100% coverage of climate change considerations in sectoral operational plans 
(Strategic Outcome 4.2)
7.2. Status Quo 
All nine provinces have developed climate change response strategies that include climate adaptation 
interventions. Regarding the local sphere, DEFF and the South African Local Government Association 
(SALGA) facilitated the Local Government Climate Change Support Programme which resulted in the 
development of climate change response plans for all the district municipalities in South Africa, with 
associated adaptation interventions. Many local municipalities have also developed their own climate 
change response plans using the tools from this Programme. Some provinces and municipalities are 
in the process of integrating elements of their climate change response strategies into their strategic 
plans. Regarding specific sectors, many of the national departments are currently developing climate 
change plans for their sectors and in some cases, they are taking steps to integrate these into 
departmental operational plans. In addition, some private sector businesses have developed climate 
change response strategies.41
7.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:
An effective adaptation planning that covers at least 100% of the South African sectors identified in 
the NCCAS
Action Description
4.1.1 Draft, approve, and 
implement updated National 
Climate Change Sector Plans 
to include climate change 
adaptation
This will involve ensuring that key sectors have drafted updated 
national climate change sector plans. Sector plans identified for 
inclusion of climate change adaptation interventions include: 
water, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, health, biodiversity and 
ecosystems, human settlements, and disaster risk reduction and 
management sectors, as well as, energy, mining, coast, 
transportation and infrastructure. These sector plans must be 
reviewed and published every five years.
4.1.2 Draft, approve, and 
implement updated 
provincial climate change 
adaptation strategies and 
associated implementation 
plans
This will involve each province drafting updated climate change 
strategies that include adaptation responses and drafting 
associated implementation plans to guide climate response in 
their province. These strategies and associated implementation 
plans should be reviewed and updated every five years.
4.1.3 Draft, approve, and 
implement updated 
municipal climate change 
adaptation strategies and 
associated implementation 
plans
This will involve each municipality drafting updated climate 
change strategies that include adaptation responses and drafting 
associated implementation plans to guide climate response in the 
respective municipality. Local municipalities should use the 
District municipal plans as resources. These strategies and 
associated implementation plans must be reviewed and updated 
every five years.
Achieve a 100% coverage of climate change considerations in sectoral operational plans
Action Description
4.2.1 Integrate climate 
change adaptation into 
Provincial Growth and 
Development Strategies
This will involve each province ensuring that climate change 
projects and programmes are reflected in their strategic Provincial 
Growth and Development Strategies.
4.2.2 Integrate climate 
change adaptation into 
provincial sector plans.
This will involve ensuring that all priority sectors at a provincial 
level incorporate climate change into their strategic planning 
documents.42
Action Description
4.2.3 Amend Development 
Planning guidelines to 
incorporate climate change 
adaptation considerations
This will involve establishing a working group involving the National 
Planning Commission, DEFF, provincial representatives, South 
African Local Government Association, and civil society to amend 
existing development planning guidelines, at all levels including 
spatial planning, to include climate change adaptation.
4.2.4 Integrate climate 
change adaptation into 
Municipal Development 
Planning documents, budget 
documents, and by-laws. 
This will involve each municipality ensuring that climate change 
projects and programmes are reflected in municipal strategic 
development planning and budget documents, including Integrated 
Development Plans (IDPs), Spatial Development Frameworks 
(SDFs), and Service Delivery and Budget Implementation Plans 
(SDBIPs). It will also involve incorporating climate change into 
municipal by-laws. 
4.2.5 Integrate climate 
change adaptation into 
municipal sector plans. 
This will involve ensuring that all priority sectors at a municipal 
level incorporate climate change into their strategic planning 
documents.
4.2.6 Mandate that all public 
infrastructure (including 
transport and energy 
infrastructure) be planned, 
designed, operated and 
managed after explicitly 
taking current and predicted 
future climate change 
impacts into account.
This will involve the Office of the President ensuring that all sectors 
factor climate change into infrastructure planning and 
development. It will entail capacity building and training of staff to 
ensure sufficient technical expertise in this transition.
4.2.7 Mainstream climate 
change adaptation in 
business strategic 
implementation plans
This will involve the provision of support to private sector 
businesses to incorporate climate change adaptation into their 
strategic implementation plans.43
8. Research
Strategic Intervention 5: Promote research application, technology development, transfer and 
adoption to support planning and implementation.
8.1. Introduction
Climate change will result in significant physical and socioeconomic effects in South Africa. It is 
important that decisions made in planning for these effects are based on access to accurate and 
current data and a wide range of both social science and physical science research. Investment in highquality climate modelling data and research on the projected impacts of climate change, among much 
other research, will help reduce risk and enable the development of more effective actions. Currently 
there are many institutions involved in climate related research in South Africa. However, there is a 
lack of coordination between the different institutions and no central database or platform where 
climate related data is shared. 
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Increased research output and technology uptake 
to support planning and implementation (Strategic Outcome 5.1).
8.2. Status Quo 
A wide range of institutions are involved in climate observation, modelling and climate-relevant
research in South Africa. These include governmental agencies like the South African Weather Services 
(SAWS) and government departments such as the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI); and 
academic and research institutions, such as those based at, but not limited to, the University of Cape 
Town, Rhodes University, the University of the North-West, and the University of the Witwatersrand. 
There are also various NGOs and community organisations that contribute to the research space in 
climate adaptation. 
8.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:
8.3.1. Increased research output and technology uptake to support planning and implementation44
Action Description
5.1.1 Develop a 
research roadmap for 
climate change 
adaptation
This will involve developing a roadmap for climate change adaptation 
research in South Africa, and will involve identifying areas where new and 
additional research is required in South Africa, and recommending 
priorities for research and development funding. Research on climate 
change adaptation is not limited to climate science and will require a crossdisciplinary approach. Research should also include social and human 
sciences skills specialists, such as gender analysts, sociologists and 
historians. Some potential areas to research include the relationship 
between climate change and rural urban migration; adopting a regional 
approach to climate change; investigating impacts of forestry on water 
availability in the face of climate change; Investigating the vulnerability of 
the current building stock to climate shock; research into building the 
adaptive capacity of infrastructure; investigating the gendered impacts of 
climate change as well as gendered vulnerabilities and capacities etc.
5.1.2 Continue to 
invest in research that 
aims to understand 
the different impacts 
of climate change on 
the environment, 
economy and society
This will involve continued support for different research institutions that 
are developing an understanding of the impacts of climate change on the 
environment, economy and society, as well as the opportunities for 
different sectors. These include research reports such as the Long Term 
Adaptation Scenarios (LTAS) which outline adaptation scenarios for South 
Africa under projected future climate conditions.
5.1.3 Invest in 
research on the most 
effective adaptation 
responses to different 
climate change 
impacts
This will involve continued support for research into the most effective 
adaptation responses and new technological solutions that can be 
replicated.
5.1.4 Establish a 
programme to 
promote research into 
new climate change 
adaptation 
technologies
This will involve establishing a programme to promote research into new 
climate change adaptation technologies.
5.1.5 Establish a 
knowledge 
dissemination 
programme to 
encourage research 
uptake
This will involve establishing a programme to promote the dissemination of 
new climate change adaptation research knowledge and information on 
new technologies that have been developed to stakeholders to promote 
uptake of the research and information.45
9. Awareness and Capacity Building
This section presents the approach to implementing Strategic Intervention 6: Build the necessary 
capacity and awareness for climate change responses.
9.1. Introduction 
The importance of focusing on education in the climate change field is highlighted in the NCCRP (DEA 
2011). Climate change is a challenge that will impact on multiple sectors and requires systematic 
interventions in order to improve the awareness and capacity of a range of stakeholders. Despite the 
advances made in South Africa since 1994, many adults, particularly women, cannot read and write, 
and therefore it is crucial that these stakeholders are also considered when creating communication 
and awareness programmes. Stakeholders need to understand the causes, impacts, and key 
vulnerabilities associated with climate change, as well as how to respond to these vulnerabilities (DEA 
2011). One of the most effective ways of improving awareness is to mainstream climate change into 
different education and training curricula at different levels, such as schools and tertiary institutions. 
Awareness and capacity are also particularly important in all three government spheres so that 
politicians and officials are equipped to guide climate change response in their respective jurisdictions. 
Since new knowledge is being generated on the impacts of climate change and appropriate responses, 
awareness and capacity building is required on an ongoing basis. 
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Capacity building and awareness for climate change 
response enhanced (Strategic Outcome 6.1).
9.2. Status Quo 
There are a wide variety of stakeholders that currently provide climate change related education, 
training, and awareness programmes in South Africa, including NGOs, academic institutions, 
businesses and government entities. Climate change is also featured in school curricula and tertiary 
level courses. 
At the school level, climate change and sustainability has been included in different subjects from 
grade 1–12 in the national Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS). Climate change 
education materials have also been developed for teachers through the Fundisa for Change 
programme. At the university level, there are a variety of climate change Honours and Master’s degree 
programmes being offered at many of the universities. Furthermore, a number of different research 
institutions and centres have been established in association with universities that focus on different 
aspects of climate change and sustainability (DEA 2017).
In the NGO sector, there are a wide range of local and international NGOs that work in different parts 
of the country in the climate change education and awareness sphere. These organisations are diverse 
and work on different climate change related sectors and with different stakeholders. A number of 
these NGOs work directly with the youth (DEA 2017).
In the business sector, associations, groups and forums play a role in educating business on the 
possible impacts and opportunities in the sustainability and climate change field and help to promote 
discussion and knowledge sharing in the private sector (DEA 2017).46
In the government sector, capacity and skills in the climate change field have been identified as key 
challenges faced by government officials in responding to climate change (DEA 2016b). DEFF together 
with SALGA developed the Let's Respond Toolkit and Local Government Climate Change Support 
Programme to capacitate district and local municipality officials to understand the basics of climate 
change, how to identify their climate change vulnerabilities, and how to develop response plans. This 
programme adopted a hands-on approach during the workshops and developed a project website 
(http://www.letsrespondtoolkit.org) where officials could access the programme materials in their 
own time. All district municipalities were included in the programme and benefited from the capacity 
building and training exercises. 
9.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:
Capacity building and awareness for climate change response enhanced
Action Description
6.1.1 Develop and 
implement an effective 
communication and 
outreach programme
This will involve developing a communication strategy that should 
consider approaches such as: knowledge sharing events, repositories of 
information on climate change impacts, climate change forums, resources, 
translation of climate science into actionable policies and plans. The 
communication strategy should be inclusive and take into account gender, 
vulnerable groups and those that cannot read and write. Furthermore the 
strategy should also provide the opportunity for groups to also contribute 
to the co-creation of knowledge in the field, and recognise the importance 
of indigenous knowledge systems.
The communication strategy should then be launched and a continuous 
communications campaign implemented. The content and target 
audiences should be revised annually based on learnings and feedback. 
The target audiences should prioritise the most vulnerable groups. 
Government should work closely with community based organisations and 
civil society organisations in the development and implementation of the 
communication and outreach programme. Proposed key messaging for 
the training programme can be found in Annex A.47
Action Description
6.1.2 Develop and 
implement a training 
programme for 
government officials
and politicians
This will involve developing and implementing a training programme for 
government officials and politicians. Since a number of training initiatives 
already exist to promote the development of adaptive capacity by 
government officials and politicians, such as the Let's Respond Toolkit for 
municipalities, and SALGA’s training on climate change for councillors, the 
programme will ensure that there is a unified approach to climate change 
adaptation training and that the impacts of the programme are 
monitored.
The programme can then be revised annually based on learnings and 
feedback. The training programme should incorporate training to develop 
the technical capacity within the various spheres of government and key 
sector institutions that help build climate resilience and develop risk 
response strategies.
In addition, the training programme should aim to build capacity to 
mainstream climate change adaptation into planning, programmes and 
new developments or projects throughout all spheres of government.
6.1.3 Establish formally 
accredited training 
courses
This will involve establishing one or more formally accredited climate 
change adaptation training courses for government officials to ensure 
consistency in training and to support the professional development of 
participating officials. This action will be implemented by government in 
partnership with other stakeholders such as research institutions.
6.1.4 Develop a Climate 
Change Adaptation and 
Environmental 
Education and Training 
Programme
This will involve developing a broader climate change adaptation and 
environmental education training programme for implementation across 
all sectors of society.
6.1.5 Incorporate 
climate change 
adaptation into 
relevant, primary,
secondary and tertiary 
curricula
This will involve incorporating climate change adaptation into relevant 
primary, secondary and tertiary curricula to mainstream climate change 
knowledge into education and training. It should form part of the broader 
framework of education on sustainable development, be interdisciplinary 
and aim to equip South African citizens to orient society and the economic 
system towards climate resilience and sustainability. This action will be 
implemented by government in partnership with research institutions.
6.1.6 Incorporate 
climate change into 
informal education and 
learning 
Establish reflective learning forums and committees where peer-to-peer 
learning and sharing of information on climate change adaptation can be 
shared informally amongst different stakeholders. 
6.1.7 Enhance social 
learning amongst all 
levels of society.
This will involve enhancing social learning on climate change adaptation at 
all levels and be inclusive of gender. 48
Action Description
6.1.8 Develop climate 
change education 
materials that can be 
used for different 
sectors and contexts. 
This will involve developing climate change education materials that can be 
used for different sectors and in different contexts. This will also include 
downscaling climate science to a sector and geographical scale. 49
10. Governance and Legislation
Strategic Intervention 7: Establish effective governance and legislative processes to integrate climate 
change in development planning.
10.1. Introduction
South Africa’s international climate change commitments, the global sustainability movement, as well 
as changes experienced in climate have resulted in many government sectors and departments, as 
well as private organisations and communities, implementing climate change adaptation and related 
projects in South Africa. Despite some coordination taking place in different spheres and sectors, 
clarity around mandates, especially in the government sector, is unclear in current legislation. 
Communication between different sectors is lacking and there is a risk that organisations are 
conducting similar work, making use of funds that could be better spent. Adopting a more integrated 
approach to climate change where roles, responsibilities and mandates are clear and where
partnerships are promoted will help to ensure that South Africa’s climate change adaptation goals are 
met timeously and efficiently. 
The key outcomes for this strategic intervention are:
● Adaptation governance defined and legislated through the Climate Change Act once approved 
by parliament (Strategic Outcome 7.1).
● Institutional structures for climate change adaptation strengthened (Strategic Outcome 7.2).
● Enhanced public-private-civil society collaboration and stewardship (Strategic Outcome 7.3).
10.2. Status Quo
Governance 
Climate change adaptation responses are currently being implemented by different spheres of 
government and other sectors, such as business and research institutions. The current roles and 
responsibilities for the three spheres of government and for non-government entities regarding
climate change adaptation are outlined below:
● National Government: The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF), a 
UNFCCC focal point, is the lead department responsible for coordinating the implementation 
of the NCCAS. Other line function national departments are responsible for integrating climate 
change response into their sectors.
● Provincial Government: Each province has an environmental department that is responsible 
for leading climate change response. Other line function provincial departments are 
responsible for integrating climate change response into their sectors. 
● Municipalities: Many critical actions required for climate change responses fall within the 
responsibility of municipalities. These include the provision of basic services (water, 
electricity, waste removal, and sanitation and sewage infrastructure maintenance), road 
management, disaster risk management, and the provision of safe and healthy human 
settlements. 
● The private sector: Climate change will affect business in several ways, including through 
potential changes to supply chains and direct climate risks posed to operations and assets. As 
business becomes more proactive in dealing with climate risk, their insights, experiences and 
resources will provide significant opportunities to leverage public sector benefits. 50
● Civil society: Civil society plays a pivotal role in advising on and supporting adaptation 
initiatives. Civil society groups are directly affected by the risks posed by a changing climate 
and the opportunities created by adaptation initiatives. Civil society can raise awareness 
about the need to adapt, facilitate debates, and support and monitor local implementation. 
● Labour: Labour plays a pivotal role in advising on and supporting adaptation initiatives. Labour 
groups are directly affected by the risks posed by a changing climate and the opportunities 
created by adaptation initiatives. Labour has played a significant role in redressing past 
inequities in South Africa and is an influential agent of change and transformation.
● Academia and research: Academia is central to efforts to improve the understanding of 
climate science, vulnerabilities and the effects of climate change, as well as governance, 
political science, policy, psychology and communication related aspects central to a holistic 
climate change response, and to provide information on appropriate sectoral and communitybased responses. 
● Community leadership: Community leaders are critical partners in the implementation and 
awareness of climate change adaptation initiatives. 
Coordinating Structures
At national level, there are several institutional structures that aim to improve coordination across 
departments and alignment in national efforts. The three key national climate change adaptation 
structures are:
● the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change
● the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change (IGCCC)
● the National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC)
In the provincial sphere, many of the environmental provincial departments have established 
provincial climate change forums where provincial stakeholders can learn about climate change and 
coordinate their climate change responses. In the local sphere DEFF’s Municipal Climate Change 
Support Programme has been rolled out through established forums and working groups at municipal 
level. These are important platforms on which to build capacity and strengthen responses to climate 
change. 
Legislation
A draft National Climate Change Bill (2018) has been developed for South Africa that outlines an 
integrated approach to responding to and preparing for climate change. The bill was published in June 
2018 and went through a public comment review period. 51
10.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:
Adaptation governance defined and legislated through the Climate Change Act once approved by 
parliament
Action Description
7.1.1 Create formal 
climate change 
legislation for 
adaptation
This will involve developing Climate Change legislation and taking it 
through the parliamentary process for enactment. This is required as 
South Africa’s rich body of climate resilience and adaptation knowledge, 
as reflected in policies, strategies and white papers, needs to be 
translated into a Climate Change Act. This will enable government’s 
commitments to be backed up by legislation.
Institutional support structures for climate change adaptation strengthened
Action Description
7.2.1 Facilitate the 
meeting of the InterMinisterial Committee 
on Climate Change
This will involve ensuring that the Inter-Ministerial Committee on 
Climate Change is set up and meets on a regular basis. The InterMinisterial Committee on Climate Change will aim to coordinate climate 
change efforts across sector departments and spheres of government.
7.2.2 Continue to 
facilitate the meeting 
of the 
Intergovernmental 
Committee on Climate 
Change (IGCCC)
This will involve ensuring that the IGCCC continues to meet on a regular 
basis. The IGCCC fosters information exchange, consultation, agreement 
and support among the spheres of government regarding climate 
change and government’s response to climate change. As a high-level 
platform, it brings together representatives from National Treasury and 
the national departments of environment, forestry and fisheries; 
agriculture, land and rural development; minerals and energy; health; 
human settlements, water and sanitation; international relations and 
cooperation; trade and industry; transport; science and innovation; 
social development; and provincial environment departments; and from 
the South African Local Government Association (SALGA).52
Action Description
7.2.3 Establish a 
functioning Provincial 
Committee on Climate 
Change for each 
province (this can be 
an existing forum).
This will involve each province establishing a Provincial Committee on 
Climate Change, managed by the provincial environmental departments.
This can however, be an existing forum, such as the disaster management 
provincial forums, that incorporates climate change issues on the agenda.
The role of these committees is to coordinate climate change response 
actions in the relevant provinces (some provinces have already 
established such committees). The composition of these committees will 
be determined by the provincial lead departments. Potential stakeholders 
on these committees could include: Representatives from relevant 
provincial departments, political representation, civil 
society/business/academia, and representation from municipalities.
7.2.4 Establish a 
functioning Municipal 
Committee on Climate 
Change for each 
municipality
This will involve each municipality establishing a Municipal Committee on 
Climate Change. The role of these committees is to coordinate climate 
change response actions in the relevant municipalities (some 
municipalities have already established committees). The composition of 
these committees will be determined by the Municipal Lead departments. 
Potential stakeholders on these committees could include: 
Representatives from relevant municipal departments, political 
representation, and civil society/business/academia.
Enhanced public-private-civil society collaboration and stewardship
Action Description
7.3.1 Continue to 
facilitate the meeting 
of the National 
Committee on Climate 
Change (NCCC), a 
multistakeholder 
climate change forum.
This will involve ensuring that the NCCC continues to meet on a regular
basis. The NCCC is a multistakeholder climate change forum that consists 
of stakeholders from government departments, civil society, business, 
and academia. The forum advises DEFF on international climate change 
commitments and national climate change implementation. A wide 
range of stakeholders will be consulted under the NCCC.
7.3.2 Implement 
collaborative pilot 
resilience-building 
projects
This will involve government implementing resilience-building pilot 
projects jointly with business and industry, and with civil society and 
communities to demonstrate the benefits of building climate change 
resilience to the private sector and communities. These pilot projects can 
serve as the catalysts for future climate adaptation work in these sectors. 
Lessons from existing successful resilience-building projects should also 
be shared. Private-public partnerships could also be explored. 53
Action Description
7.3.3 Continue to 
support knowledge 
sharing platforms
This will involve providing continued support to community-based 
organisations, academic organisations, NGOs, business organisations and 
civil society organisations which provide platforms where lessons, ideas, 
and knowledge can be shared to build climate resilience. This will 
promote learning from the experiences of stakeholders in different 
sectors, including NGOs, academia, business and communities to 
support adaptation to climate change.54
11. Finance
Strategic Intervention 8: Enable substantial flows of climate change adaptation finance from various 
sources.
11.1. Introduction
The projected cost range for South African adaptation response from 2020 to 2030 under the low 
mitigation scenario is between R4.2 bn and R308 bn (DEA 2015a, 5). For the moderate to high 
mitigation scenario the project cost range is R34 bn to R298 bn (DEA 2015a, 5). The wide-ranging 
projected costs in these scenarios reflect the lack of certainty and data regarding the effects of climate 
variability, which make it difficult to calculate the cost of adaptation. However, it is clear that 
substantial finance will be required to implement the NCCAS in order to achieve meaningful 
adaptation in South Africa. 
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Adequate financial resources for national 
adaptation priorities from the national fiscus and international sources (Strategic Outcome 8.1) 
11.2. Status Quo
Adaptation initiatives that are spread across government departments are very often not labelled as 
adaptation projects. The primary funding for adaptation activities in South Africa is through direct 
allocations from the national budget via the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) including 
expenditure on research programmes and activities that directly contribute to building and supporting 
resilience. The other principal source of public sector finances are public intermediaries. Relevant 
public intermediaries for South Africa include the Global Environment Facility (which functions as an 
operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC); Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)
such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the World Bank and the African 
Development Bank; and Official Development Assistance Institutions and Climate Funds, for example 
the Green Fund, the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund.
South Africa’s private sector has also invested in adaptation activities, including sustainable farming 
practices, building ecological infrastructure and improving water infrastructure. Going forward, the 
private sector will play a strategic role in both implementation and funding.
Civil society and other community groups and NGOs also play a vital role in developing and 
implementing adaptation projects and programmes, especially for grassroots communities including 
women.
A range of economic and financial instruments exist that are being employed by both private and 
public investors to support adaptation projects. These include grants, equity, concessional and nonconcessional loans and debt, and the operational funding of private and state-owned companies. 
More recently, leading private sector companies are using combinations of these instruments to 
mainstream adaptation into their operational activities (for example, an energy company investing in 
improving the resilience of its transmission lines to extreme weather events) or a company that 55
develops products and services that support adaptation (such as a seed company developing droughtresistant seeds).
11.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:
Adequate financial resources for national adaptation priorities from national fiscus and 
international sources
Action Description
8.1.1 Carry out a costbenefit analysis of the 
NCCAS
This will involve developing a cost-benefit analysis of the NCCAS,
initially to determine the full cost of implementing the NCCAS. 
Thereafter the benefits of the NCCAS will be identified and 
quantified.
8.1.2 Develop a gender 
responsive Resource 
Mobilisation Strategy
This will involve developing a resource mobilisation strategy, 
through a participatory process involving different stakeholders, that 
will highlight all activities involved in securing new and additional 
resources for implementing the Strategy. The Resource mobilisation 
strategy will also recommend ways to maximise the use of existing 
resources and ensure that the most vulnerable groups are included
and that they are beneficiaries.
8.1.3 Develop a gender 
responsive national 
climate investment plan
This will involve developing a national climate investment plan, 
through a participatory process involving different stakeholders, 
which will provide an overview of a set of robust and financeable 
adaptation projects and programmes for consideration by domestic 
and international funders. The plan will ensure that the most 
vulnerable groups are included and that they are beneficiaries.
8.1.4 Expand the list of 
government entities 
accredited for climate 
financing
This will involve identifying additional government entities that 
would be appropriate to accredit for climate financing and 
supporting them through the accreditation process. The throughput 
of adaptation projects to dedicated multilateral climate funds would 
be maximised by expanding the list of accredited government 
entities to include well-capacitated municipalities and provinces.
8.1.5 Build capacity of 
local accredited 
implementing entities to 
access adaptation finance
This will involve building the capacity of accredited implementing 
entities to improve their ability to secure finance. This will assist 
South Africa to maximise the allocation of adaptation finance from 
dedicated multilateral climate funds.
8.1.6 Develop a project 
preparation assistance 
fund
This will involve establishing a project preparation fund to support 
entities with the potential to prepare applications but insufficient 
internal funding for the process.56
Action Description
8.1.7 Mainstream NCCAS 
priorities into the Medium 
Term Strategic Framework 
and assign 
implementation 
responsibilities
This will involve mainstreaming NCCAS priorities into the Medium 
Term Strategic Framework and assigning implementation 
responsibilities to ensure that the NCCAS is implemented by sectors 
and spheres of government.
8.1.8 Investigate options 
to include climate change 
adaptation parameters in 
the equitable share 
allocations of state 
revenue calculations
This will involve investigating options to include climate change 
adaptation parameters in the equitable share allocations of state 
revenue calculations.
8.1.9 Promote knowledge 
exchange on the economic 
benefits of public and 
private sector adaptation 
action
This will involve documenting public and private sector adaptation 
actions and the economic benefits of these actions, and ensuring 
that this information is shared widely. This will assist in promoting 
the uptake of adaptation action by other public and private sector 
entities.
8.1.10 Invest in new 
gender responsive 
technology and 
innovation.
This will involve investing in new technologies and innovations that 
can support climate change adaptation in South Africa. 
8.1.11 Build a business 
case for adaptation in 
terms of national 
budgeting for adaptation 
and develop co-finance 
mechanisms to leverage 
donor funds.
This will involve building a business case for adaptation in terms of 
national budgeting for adaptation actions in the country and 
developing co-finance mechanisms to leverage donor funds.
8.1.12 Create a financial 
oversight mechanism for 
donor funding.
This will involve ensuring that the public have oversight over 
adaptation finance. 57
12. Monitoring and Evaluation
Strategic Intervention 9: Develop and implement an M&E system that tracks implementation of 
adaptation actions and their effectiveness.
12.1. Introduction 
Since the effects of climate change differ across geographies and will shift over time, adaptation 
actions will work in some locations and time periods, and not in others. A ‘learning by doing’ approach 
is therefore needed. This approach will help South Africa progressively improve the NCCAS, and as a 
result, its ability to deal with the inherent uncertainty of climate change science. In order to implement 
a learning by doing approach the strategic outcomes of the NCCAS must be monitored and evaluated 
to understand whether progress has been made towards achieving these strategic interventions. The 
results of this monitoring and evaluation can then be used to determine if any shifts are required in 
terms of the strategic outcomes of the NCCAS. 
The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: A national M&E system developed and implemented 
(Strategic Outcome 9.1)
12.2. Status Quo 
The Climate Change Adaptation Monitoring and Evaluation approach for South Africa has been 
organised into Desired Adaptation Outcomes (DAOs). Nine generic DAOs have been developed, each 
of which is of cross-cutting, cross-sectoral relevance and describes, in a general sense, a desired state 
that will enhance South Africa’s transition towards climate resilience. These DAOs fall into two distinct 
groups: six DAOs, goal 1 to goal 6, (G1-G6) describe the inputs (for example, processes, resources and 
capacities) that need to be in place to enable effective climate change adaptation; and three DAOs 
(G7-G9) describe the key impacts of adaptation interventions and associated measures (for example,
reductions in vulnerability of human and natural systems). These DAOs are shown in the table below.
Desired Adaptation Outcomes (DAOs)
Inputs to enable effective adaptation
G1 Robust/integrated policies, programmes and plans for effective delivery of climate 
change adaptation, together with monitoring, evaluation and review over the short, 
medium and longer-term.
G2 Appropriate resources (including current and past financial investments), capacity and 
processes (human, legal and regulatory) and support mechanisms (institutional and 
governance structures) to facilitate climate change adaptation.
G3 Accurate climate information (e.g. historical trend data, seasonal predictions, future 
projections, and early warning of extreme weather and other climate-related events) 
provided by existing and new monitoring and forecasting facilities/networks (including 
their maintenance and enhancement) to inform adaptation planning and disaster risk 
reduction.58
Desired Adaptation Outcomes (DAOs)
Inputs to enable effective adaptation
G4 Capacity development, education and awareness programmes (formal and informal) for 
climate change adaptation (for example informed by adaptation research and with tools 
to utilise data/outputs).
G5 New and adapted technologies, knowledge, research and other cost-effective measures 
(for example nature-based solutions) used in climate change adaptation.
G6 Climate change risks, impacts and vulnerabilities identified and addressed.
Impacts of adaptation interventions and associated measures
G7 Systems, infrastructure, communities and sectors less vulnerable to climate change 
impacts (for example, through effectiveness of adaptation interventions/response 
measures).
G8 Non-climate pressures and threats to human and natural systems reduced (particularly 
where these compound climate change impacts).
G9 Secure food, water and energy supplies for all citizens (within the context of climate 
change and sustainable development).
Clearly defined synergies exist between the NCCAS strategic outcomes and the climate change 
adaptation monitoring and evaluation – and, by implication, their corresponding data/information 
requirements and potential data/information outputs. This should help to ensure a robust approach 
to reporting on adaptation in South Africa and monitoring the country’s journey towards climate 
resilience. The relationship between the twelve NACCS strategic outcomes and the Desired Adaptation 
Outcomes for climate change adaptation monitoring and evaluation is shown in the table below:
Strategic Outcomes Desired Adaptation Outcomes for monitoring and evaluation

Strategic Outcome 8.1: 
Adequate financial resources of 
national adaptation priorities 
from national fiscus and 
international sources
Appropriate resources (including current and past financial 
investments) to facilitate climate change adaptation (G2).
Strategic Outcome 9.1: A 
national M&E system 
developed and implemented
Robust monitoring, evaluation and review over the short, medium 
and longer-term (G1).
A climate change M&E system focusing on tracking
The M&E system will focus on tracking the outcomes and impact of each strategic outcome together 
with the associated actions and indicators under each strategic outcome. The information/data 
collected through M&E will be analysed and profiled on the Climate Change Information System. The 
National Climate Change Information System (NCCIS) was recently launched and is part of the national 
effort to track South Africa’s overall transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy as 
required by the National Development Plan (Vision 2030) and the National Climate Change Response 
Policy (2011) as well as the South Africa’s Nationally Determined Contributions (2015) to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
The NCCIS offers a series of methodologies and decision support tools that can be used to apply tools 
to enhance tracking, assessment and communication of the effects of climate action response policies 
and actions in an accurate, consistent and, transparent manner at all scales of implementation to 
inform policy and decision-making. 
The information generated by the system can be used to provide insights regarding the country’s 
progress in responding to climate change as implemented by a range of stakeholders and; achieving 
national and international goals and targets. It further showcases necessary information for domestic 
and international reporting requirements and informs positions in various negotiating platforms 
nationally and internationally. 
Structured pragmatic engagements, tailored made for targeted stakeholders within adaptation 
landscape, will be undertaken with for capacity building on M&E. These engagements will also be used 
to provide progress on M&E and will highlight challenges, gaps, opportunities and lessons learnt.
12.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:61
A national M&E system developed and implemented 
Action Description
9.1.1 Establish a M&E system 
to track progress in achieving 
the strategic outcomes of the 
NCCAS
This will involve setting up an effective M&E system to track and 
assess success in achieving the strategic outcomes of the NCCAS. 
Proposed indicators for each strategic outcome are shown in Annex 
B.
9.1.2 Report on success in 
achieving the strategic 
outcomes of the NCCAS
This will involve using the information collected in the M&E system 
to report annually on progress in achieving the strategic outcomes. 
The report should also highlight key lessons learnt as well as any 
shifts that may be required to achieve the strategic outcomes of 
the NCCAS.
9.1.3 Update the NCCAS based 
on the M&E learnings
This will involve updating the NCCAS every five years based on the 
learnings that have been developed as a result of the establishment 
of an M&E system and development of annual reports.
9.1.4 Ensure that M&E 
information is accessible to 
stakeholders
This will involve that M&E tracking reports are communicated 
effectively at a community level in accessible formats.62

14. Annex A: Proposed Key Messaging for Climate Change 
Adaptation Communication and outreach programme
● Adapting to create a resilient South Africa has been conceptualised as the key message of 
the NCCAS: This message will be central to all NCCAS related communications during both the 
strategy development phase and implementation phase. In addition, there are a number of 
subsidiary messages which reinforce the key message.
● South Africa needs to adapt to climate change: Sustained warming and increasing rainfall 
variability over the short to medium term (the next two to three decades) will have 
increasingly adverse effects on key sectors of South Africa’s economy in the absence of 
effective adaptation responses.
● Climate change threatens development: The projected adverse effects of ongoing climate 
change in South Africa are likely to threaten the achievement of urgent national development 
needs, and well-founded aspirations to address historical inequities. 
● The poor are most vulnerable to climate change impacts: The increasing frequency of 
extreme weather events is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the poorest in society 
(both rural and urban), amplifying existing social inequalities. The poor typically have limited 
opportunities and, consequently, are disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of 
climate change.
● The NCCAS will give South Africa an advantage in the future: Planning for climate change 
ensures that South Africa is in a position to leverage opportunities that arise due to changing 
climatic conditions and enhance its global competitiveness.
● Climate change presents investment opportunities: New funding flows to support adaptation 
represent the biggest acceleration of development investment since the achievement of 
democracy in South Africa. This provides a unique opportunity to both ensure climate 
resilience and achieve development aspirations.
● Transformational change: Transformational, systemic change is required to address the 
challenges presented by climate change. 
● The need for integration and collaboration: Sectoral and integrated cross-sectoral 
approaches are essential to building societal resilience in a holistic way. 
● Linkages between adaptation and mitigation are increasingly vital: This is because there is 
an intensified international focus on keeping global warming below 2°C, and therefore 
adaptation responses need to be cognisant of their mitigation implications. At the same time, 
the adverse impacts of climate change on resource availability potentially limits energy 
development options. An adaptation and mitigation strategy requires integrated planning. For 
instance, some forms of energy generation require large amounts of water. Since South Africa 
is projected to experience drier conditions under some climate change scenarios, shortages 
of water could limit energy development options.75
