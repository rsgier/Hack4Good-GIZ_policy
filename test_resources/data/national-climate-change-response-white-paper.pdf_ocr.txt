EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Climate change is already a measurable reality and along
with other developing countries, South Africa is especially
vulnerable to its impacts. This White Paper presents the
South African Government's vision for an effective climate
change response and the long-term, just transition to a
climate-resilient and lower-carbon economy and society.
South Africa’s response to climate change has two objectives:

* Effectively manage inevitable climate change impacts
through interventions that build and sustain South
Africa’s social, economic and environmental resilience
and emergency response capacity.

s Make a fair contribution to the global effort to
stabilise greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level that avoids dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system
within a timeframe that enables economic, social
and environmental development to proceed in a
sustainable manner.

This response is guided by principles set out in the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the National Environmental
Management Act, the Millennium Declaration and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. These principles are detailed in section 3.

The overall strategic approach for South Africa’s climate
change response is customised;
developmental; transformational, empowering and
participatory; dynamic and evidence-based; balanced and
cost effective; and integrated and aligned.

needs driven and

In terms of strategic priorities, the White Paper sets out
South Africa’s climate change response strategy to achieve
the National Climate Change Response Objective in a
manner consistent with the outlined principles and approach
and which is structured around the following strategic
priorities: risk reduction and management; mitigation
actions with significant outcomes; sectoral responses;
policy and regulatory alignment; informed decision making
and planning; integrated planning; technology research,
development and innovation; facilitated behaviour change;
behaviour change through choice;and resource mobilisation.

See section 4 for details of the elements of the response
policy.

In terms of adaptation, the National Climate Change
Response includes a risk-based process to identify and
prioritise short- and medium-term adaptation interventions

 

to be addressed in sector plans. The process will also
identify the adaptation responses that require coordination
between sectors and departments and it will be reviewed
every five years. For the immediate future, sectors that
need particular attention are water, agriculture and forestry,
health, biodiversity and human settlements. Resilience
to climate variability and climate change-related extreme
weather events will be the basis for South Africa’s future
approach to disaster management and we will use region-
wide approaches where appropriate.

Section 5 expands on the adaptation part of the response
policy.

South Africa’s approach to mitigation, which is addressed
by section 6 of the response policy, balances the country’s
contribution as a responsible global citizen to the
international effort to curb global emissions with the
economic and social opportunities presented by the
transition to a lower-carbon economy as well as with
the requirement that the country successfully tackles the
development challenges facing it.

The key elements in the overall approach to mitigation
will be:

° Using a National GHG Emissions Trajectory Range,
against which the collective outcome of all mitigation
actions will be measured;

. Defining desired emission reduction outcomes
for each significant sector and sub-sector of the
economy based on an in-depth assessment of the
mitigation potential, best available mitigation options,
science, evidence and a full assessment of the costs

and benefits;

* Adopting a carbon budget approach to provide for
flexibility and least-cost mechanisms for companies
in relevant sectors and/or sub-sectors and, where
appropriate, translating carbon budgets into company
level desired emission reduction outcomes.

* Requiring companies and economic sectors or
sub-sectors for which desired emission reduction
outcomes have been established to prepare and
submit mitigation plans that set out how they intend
to achieve the desired emission reduction outcomes.

. Developing and implementing a wide range and
mix of different types of mitigation approaches,
policies, measures and actions that optimise the
  

mitigation outcomes as well as job creation and other
sustainable developmental benefits. This optimal mix
of mitigation actions will be developed to achieve
the defined desired emission reduction outcomes
for each sector and sub-sector of the economy by
ensuring that actions are specifically tailored to the
potential, best available solutions and other relevant
conditions related to the specific sector, sub-sector
or organisation concerned;

* The deployment of a range of economic instruments
to support the system of desired emissions reduction
outcomes, including the appropriate pricing of carbon
and economic incentives, as well as the possible use
of emissions offset or emission reduction trading
mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors,
companies or entities where a carbon budget
approach has been selected.

* A national system of data collection to provide
detailed, complete, accurate and up-to-date emissions
data in the form of a Greenhouse Gas Inventory and
a Monitoring and Evaluation System to support the
analysis of the impact of mitigation measures.

In addition to the direct physical impacts of climate
change, there are also secondary economic impacts
where South Africa may be economically vulnerable to
response measures - measures taken both internationally
and nationally, to reduce GHG emissions. As discussed in
section 7, Government will take a multi-pronged approach
to addressing and managing response measures, especially in
respect of those that may have negative economic impacts.

A suite of Near-term Priority Flagship Programmes consisting
of both new initiatives and the scaling up of existing initiatives
will be implemented while the first sectoral desired
emission reduction outcomes and carbon budgets are being
developed and initial adaptation interventions prioritised.
This component is addressed in section 8.

For job creation, as described in section 9, the National
Climate Change Response aims to limit jobs contraction
to those areas of the economy where excessive carbon
intensity is unsustainable, whilst promoting and expanding
the green economy sectors. The National Climate Change
Response also aims to promote investment in human and
productive resources that will grow the green economy.
To do this, Government will assess the vulnerability of the
different economic sectors to climate change and develop
Sector Job Resilience Plans.

To mainstream climate-resilient development, section 10
notes that all Government departments and state-owned
enterprises will need to review the policies, strategies,
legislation, regulations and plans falling within their
jurisdictions to ensure full alignment with the National
Climate Change Response within two years of the publication
of this policy. On the basis of the outcome of these reviews,
government will determine what adjustments need to be
made to achieve alignment with the goals and objectives
of the National Climate Change Response, and will identify
any additional legislative or regulatory measures that are
needed. The National Climate Change Response itself will be
reviewed every five years from the publication of this policy.

All sectors of the South African society will take part in
the effort to mainstream climate-resilient development.
Existing institutional arrangements, such as the Cabinet
Clusters, the National Planning Commission, the Forum
of South African Directors-General, the Parliamentary
Portfolio Committee on Water and Environment Affairs,
the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, the
Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change and the
multi-stakeholder National Committee on Climate Change
will be used to drive this new policy direction.

Government departments will start communicating with
citizens about climate change to inform and educate them
and to influence their behavioural choices. This includes
setting up and maintaining early warning systems so
that people can take specific actions to reduce risks to
themselves, their households and property.

South Africa needs to mobilise financial, human and
knowledge resources to effectively address climate
change. To this end, Government will use existing financial
institutions and instruments and it will help to develop
new ones. This includes international financial assistance
specifically for climate change response actions. During the
initial period of transition to a climate-resilient and lower-
carbon economy and society, Government will establish an
interim climate finance coordination mechanism to secure

the necessary resources for priority programmes.
See section || for further details on resource mobilisation.

To formulate effective responses to climate change, South
Africa needs a country-wide monitoring system to measure
climate variables at scales appropriate to the institutions
that must implement climate change responses.
  

LeescorelU} Noms Le laa narla]

To monitor the success of responses to climate change,
and to replicate the ones that have worked well, we need
to measure their cost, outcome and impact. To this end,
South Africa will, within two years of the publication of this
policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response
Monitoring and Evaluation System. Although the Climate
Change Response Monitoring and Evaluation System will be
based on South African scientific measurement standards
and will be undertaken through the Presidency’s Outcomes-
Based System, it is expected that the system will evolve
with international Measuring, Reporting and Verification
requirements.

Section 12 details the systems needed to monitor and
evaluate climate change and our responses to it.
  

|. INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon known as “climate change”, the focus of
this policy, refers to an ongoing trend of changes in the earth’s
general weather conditions as a result of an average rise in
the temperature of the earth’s surface often referred to as
global warming. This rise in the average global temperature
is due, primarily, to the increased concentration of gases
known as greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere
that are emitted by human activities. These gases intensify
a natural phenomenon called the “greenhouse effect” by
forming an insulating layer in the atmosphere that reduces
the amount of the sun’s heat that radiates back into space
and therefore has the effect of making the earth warmer.

While weather changes on a daily basis, climate represents
the statistical distribution of weather patterns over time,
and on a global scale has changed only very slowly in the
past — usually over periods of tens of thousands of years
or even millions of years which allows time for the earth’s
bio-physical systems to adapt naturally to the changing
climatic conditions. Currently, the global climate is changing
much more rapidly as a result of global warming, leading
to, among others, the melting of polar and glacier ice, sea-
level rise, ocean acidification, changes in rainfall and snowfall
patterns, more frequent floods and droughts and increased
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such
as tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones. The rapid rate of
this climate change does not allow the earth’s bio-physical
systems to adapt to these changes naturally.

Evidence of rapid climate change, including more frequent
and intense weather systems and greater climate variability,
has already been observed and includes:

* increases in the average global temperature; with the
past decade being the hottest on record;

° rises in the average global sea level;

* changes in average rainfall patterns, with some regions
experiencing higher rainfall (e.g. Northern Europe)
and other areas experiencing drying (e.g. the Sahel
and southern Africa);

é increased frequency of heavy rainfall and extreme
weather events over most land areas; and

$ more intense and longer droughts, particularly in the
tropics and subtropics.

GHGs are emitted from, and are reabsorbed by, a variety of
natural sources, but the rate at which human economies and
societies are emitting these gases far exceeds the capacity of
natural ecosystems to reabsorb them. Increased industrial

activity since the mid-| 8th century has led to a rapid increase
in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs such as carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, in large part due to
the burning of fossil fuels derived from oil, coal and natural
gas.We also know that land-based human activities, such as
forest clearing and unsustainable agricultural practices, are
not only increasing GHG emissions from these sources, but
are also reducing the earth’s natural ability to absorb GHGs.
The evidence that current global warming is due to human
activities associated with industrialisation and modern
agriculture is overwhelming.

The rate of change to the earth’s climate exceeds the ability
of all types of ecosystems (marine, coastal, freshwater, and
terrestrial) to adapt as well as compromising their ability to
function effectively. Ecosystems provide important services
to society, such as the formation of soil; the provision of
food, fresh water, wood, fibre and fuel; the regulation of
climate, floods and the spread of disease; protection from
storm surges and floods; and a range of cultural, spiritual,
educational and recreational services. The protection of
biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems is essential to the
maintenance of these services, which is a key pillar for
sustainable development.

It is acknowledged that Africa, as a whole, has contributed
least to GHG concentrations in the atmosphere, but also
faces some of the worst consequences and generally has
the least capacity to cope with climate change impacts.
However, it is also recognised that South Africa is a
relatively significant contributor to global climate change
with significant GHG emission levels from its energy-
intensive, fossil-fuel powered economy. On the other hand,
South Africa is extremely vulnerable and exposed to the
impacts of climate change due to our socio-economic and
environmental context. Climate variability, including the
increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events, will disproportionately affect the poor. South Africa
is already a water-stressed country and we face future
drying trends and weather variability with cycles of droughts
and sudden excessive rains. We have to urgently strengthen
the resilience of our society and economy to such climate
change impacts and to develop and implement policies,
measures, mechanisms and infrastructure that protect the
most vulnerable.

The science is clear that action to address the causes and
impacts of climate change by a single country or small
group of countries will not be successful. This is a global
  

problem requiring a global solution through the concerted
and cooperative efforts of all countries. Should multi-lateral
international action not effectively limit the average global
temperature increase to below 2°C above pre-industrial
levels, the potential impacts on South Africa in the medium-
to long-term are significant and potentially catastrophic.
Even under emission scenarios that are more conservative
than current international emission trends, it has been
predicted that by mid-century the South African coast
will warm by around | to 2°C and the interior by around
2 to 3°C. By 2100, warming is projected to reach around
3 to 4°C along the coast, and 6 to 7°C in the interior.
With such temperature increases, life as we know it will
change completely: parts of the country will be much drier
and increased evaporation will ensure an overall decrease in
water availability. This will significantly affect human health,
agriculture, other water-intensive economic sectors such as
the mining and electricity-generation sectors as well as the
environment in general. Increased occurrence and severity
of veld and forest fires; extreme weather events; and floods
and droughts will also have significant impacts. Sea-level rise
will negatively impact the coast and coastal infrastructure.
Mass extinctions of endemic plant and animal species will
greatly reduce South Africa’s biodiversity with consequent
impacts on eco-system services.

Against this national context, the South African Government:

* Accepts the conclusions of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth
Assessment Report, that warming of the climate
system is unequivocal and that the increase in
GHG concentrations as a result of human activity is
primarily responsible for this warming trend.

s Regards climate change as one of the greatest threats
to sustainable development and believes that climate
change, if unmitigated, has the potential to undo or
undermine many of the positive advances made in
meeting South Africa’s own development goals and
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

* Having ratified both the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its
Kyoto Protocol, will continue to meaningfully engage
in the current multilateral negotiations to further
strengthen and enhance the international response to
the climate change crisis. The Government specifically
aims to continue its efforts to strengthen and ensure
the full implementation of the UNFCCC and its

 

Kyoto Protocol through additional multi-lateral rules-
based and legally-binding international agreements
that will come into force after 2012. These should
effectively limit the average global temperature
increase to below a maximum of 2°C above pre-
industrial levels. In so doing, South Africa will strive
to ensure that such agreements are inclusive, fair and
effective; reflect a balance between adaptation and
mitigation responses; and recognise that solving the
climate problem will only be possible if developing
countries’ priorities of eradicating poverty and
Promoting sustainable development are taken into
consideration.

Notwithstanding these ongoing __ international
negotiations, reaffirms that, in terms of the provisions
of Articles 4,5, 6 and 12 of the UNFCCC as well as
Article 10 of the Kyoto Protocol, South Africa already
has existing international legally binding obligations to:

- Formulate, implement, publish and regularly
update policies, measures and programmes to
mitigate its emission of GHGs and adapt to the
adverse effects of inevitable climate change;

- Monitor and periodically report to the
international community the country’s GHG
inventory; steps taken and envisaged to implement
the UNFCCC; and any other information relevant
to the achievement of the objective of the
UNFCCC, including information relevant for the
calculation of global emission trends;

- Sustainably manage, conserve and enhance GHG
sinks and reservoirs, including terrestrial, coastal
and marine ecosystems, biomass, forests and
oceans;

- Develop climate change response plans to
address integrated coastal zone, water resources,
agriculture, and land protection and rehabilitation;

- Mainstream climate change considerations into
social, economic and environmental policy;

- Promote and cooperate in the development,
application, diffusion and transfer of GHG emission
mitigation technologies, practices and processes;

- Further develop and support research and
systematic observation organisations, networks
and programmes as well as efforts to strengthen
systematic observation, research and technical
  

a

capacities, including promoting research and
systematic observation in areas beyond national
jurisdiction; and

- Develop and implement education, training and
public awareness programmes on climate change
and its effects to promote and facilitate scientific,
technical and managerial skills as well as public
access to information, public awareness of and
participation in addressing climate change.

Government also acknowledges that:

* Notwithstanding the effectiveness of any strengthened
international response to the climate change crisis, a
certain amount of climate change is already observed
and further climate change will be inevitable due to
the slow response (or inertia) of the climate system
to changes in the concentration of GHGs in the
atmosphere. Therefore South Africa will have to
adapt to these impacts by managing its climate and
weather-related risks, reducing its vulnerability and
increasing the resilience of our society and economy
to the adverse effects of climate change and variability;

* The stabilisation of GHG concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous
interference with the climate system requires the
implementation of a sufficiently ambitious and effective
global agreement on GHG emission reductions. In this
context, as a responsible global citizen, and in keeping
with its developing country status, its capability and its
share of responsibility for the problem, South Africa is
committed to making a fair contribution to the global
effort to reduce GHG emissions. At the same time,

the country must ensure that the necessary climate
change-related investments contribute to building
South Africa’s future economic competitiveness and
economic growth and contribute to its over-riding
national priorities for sustainable development, job
creation, improving public and environmental health
and poverty eradication; and

* That although there will be costs associated with
South Africa’s adaptation
reduction efforts, there will also be significant short
and long-term social and economic benefits, including
improved international competitiveness, that will
result from a transition to a lower-carbon economy
and society. Furthermore, various economic studies
have shown that the costs of early action will be far
less than the costs of delay and inaction.

and GHG emission

Given the cross-cutting nature of climate change impacts
and responses, Government further recognises that an
effective response to climate change requires national policy
to ensure a coordinated, coherent, efficient and effective
response to the global challenge of climate change.

The policy outlined in this White Paper embodies South
Africa’s commitment to a fair contribution to stabilising
global GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and to
protecting the country and its people from the impacts
of inevitable climate change. It presents the vision for
an effective climate change response and the long-term
transition to a climate-resilient, equitable and internationally
competitive lower-carbon economy and society — a vision
premised on Government’s commitment to sustainable
development and a better life for all.
  

2. NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE OBJECTIVE

South Africa will build the climate resilience of the country,
its economy and its people and manage the transition to a
climate-resilient, equitable and internationally competitive
lower-carbon economy and society in a manner that
simultaneously addresses South Africa’s over-riding national
priorities for sustainable development, job creation, improved
public and environmental health, poverty eradication, and
social equality. In this regard, South Africa will:

. Effectively manage inevitable climate change impacts
through interventions that build and sustain South
Africa’s social, economic and environmental resilience
and emergency response capacity.

° Make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise
GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
avoids dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system within a timeframe that enables
economic, social and environmental development to

proceed in a sustainable manner.

3. PRINCIPLES

The achievement of South Africa’s climate change response
objective is guided by the principles set out in the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the National Environmental
Management Act (NEMA), the MDGs and the UNFCCC.
The principles include, amongst others:

* Common but differentiated responsibilities and
respective capabilities — aligning our domestic
measures to reduce the country’s GHG emissions
and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change
with our unique national circumstances, stage of
development and capacity to act.

¢ Equity — ensuring a fair allocation of effort, cost
and benefits in the context of the need to address
disproportionate vulnerabilities, | responsibilities,
capabilities, disparities and inequalities.

¢ Special needs and circumstances — considering
the special needs and circumstances of localities
and people that are particularly vulnerable to the
adverse effects of climate change, including vulnerable
groups such as women, and especially poor and/or
rural women; children, especially infants and child-
headed families; the aged; the sick; and the physically
challenged.

° Uplifting the poor and vulnerable — climate change
policies and measures should address the needs of
the poor and vulnerable and ensure human dignity,
whilst endeavouring to attain environmental, social
and economic sustainability.

Intra- and _ Inter-generational sustainability
— managing our ecological, social and economic
resources and capital responsibly for current and
future generations.

The Precautionary Principle — applying a risk-averse
and cautious approach, which takes into account the
limits of current knowledge about the consequences
of decisions and actions.

The Polluter Pays Principle — those responsible
for harming the environment paying the costs of
remedying pollution and environmental degradation
and supporting any consequent adaptive response
that may be required.

Informed participation -— enhancing _ public
awareness and understanding of climate change
causes and impacts to promote participation and
action at all levels.

Economic, social and ecological pillars of
sustainable development — recognising that a
robust and sustainable economy and a_ healthy
society depends on the services that well-functioning
ecosystems provide, and that enhancing the
sustainability of the economic, social and ecological
services is an integral component of an effective and
efficient climate change response.
  

 

4. THE SOUTH AFRICAN CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE STRATEGY

Responses to climate change have been commonly
categorised as either aimed at reducing the rate at
which climate is changing to levels that occur naturally
(and especially reducing the atmospheric concentrations
of GHGs, so-called “mitigation”) or responding to the
adverse effects of climate change (“adaptation”). In addition,
there is also the issue of managing any unintended
negative consequences of climate change policies and
measures, widely referred to as “response measures”,
on other countries. However, an effective South African
climate change response requires economic, social and
environmental interventions that integrate mitigation and
adaptation elements within a developmental framework.
Furthermore, an effective South African climate change
response also requires the management of any response
measures generated by our action as well as being able to
respond to the response measures of other countries that
have negative consequences for our country. Categorising
responses as either mitigation or adaptation responses can
obscure the real and potential positive combined impact of
these responses. Thus, although this policy still retains the
mitigation and adaptation categories for the sake of clarity,
the policy also reflects a strategic approach referred to as
“climate change resilient development”.

For further clarity, the climate change response makes use
of the following time-bound planning horizons:

¢ Short-term — five years from date of publication of
the policy.

¢ Medium-term — twenty years from date of
publication of the policy.

¢ Long-term — a planning horizon that extends to 2050.

4.1 Overall Approach

Climate change resilient development refers to all
interventions — mitigation, adaptation or both — that
contribute to a fair and effective global solution to the
climate change challenge while simultaneously building and
maintaining South Africa’s international competitiveness,
its social, environmental and economic resilience to the
adverse effects of global climate change, and any unintended
consequences of global climate change response measures.
In this regard, the policy develops a “win-win” strategic
approach that is:

Needs-driven and customised — Employing a wide
range of different types of adaptation and mitigation
approaches, policies, measures, programmes,
interventions and actions consistent with the
principles outlined above, but in particular, that meet
the special needs and circumstances of those most
vulnerable as well as being specifically tailored to the
potential, best available solutions and other relevant
conditions related to the specific actor, organisation,
sector or sub-sector concerned;

Developmental — Prioritising climate change
responses that have both significant mitigation and
adaptation benefits and that also have significant
economic growth, job creation, public health, risk
management and poverty alleviation benefits;

Transformational, empowering and participatory
— Implementing policies and measures to address
climate change at a “scale of economy” that enables
and supports the required level of innovation, sector
and skills development, finance and investment flows
needed to reap the full benefit of a transition to a
lower-carbon, efficient, job-creating, equitable and
competitive economy. The transition will necessarily
be supported and enabled by policies and measures to
empower and promote the participation of all citizens
through changing their behaviour to more sustainable
lifestyles and livelihoods. This policy is therefore part
of the broader social and economic transformation
as envisaged by the New Growth Path (NGP) and is
fundamentally underpinned by a major shift towards
sustainable consumption and production patterns,
which decouples growth and development from any
negative impacts on the environment and society;

Dynamic and evidence-based — Recognising that
this policy has not been developed in a vacuum
and many sectors have already researched and have
experience in implementing policies and measures to
address the challenges of climate change. Therefore,
this policy takes an approach of:

- Immediate implementation of Near-term Priority
Flagship Programmes comprising of —

o Continued implementation of existing
successful policies and measures with only
policy alignment and integration intervention
as required;

13
  

ae 14

o Scaled-up roll-out of those existing successful

policies and measures, which have successfully
completed a demonstration phase, where
feasible;

o Implementation of proven “no-regret policies
and measures” in the immediate and near-
term (e.g. best available technologies and
best practices), particularly those that are
well researched or understood, have socio-
economic developmental and job creation
benefits, and have negative-cost, zero-cost or
low-cost implications for the economy and
society;

- Simultaneously, further researching, consulting
on, developing and demonstrating the detail of
additional policies and measures consistent with
the provisions of this policy, for implementation in
the short-, medium- and longer-term, as and when
ready; and

- Rigorously monitoring and evaluating the
effectiveness of implemented policies and
measures with a view to improving efficiency
through adjustments or discarding those that are
ineffective;

Balanced and cost effective — Implementing a
balanced approach to both climate change mitigation
and adaptation responses in terms of cost-benefit,
prioritisation, focus, action and resource allocation;
and

Integrated and aligned — Providing for the
integration of sector-related climate change
responses into the relevant sector planning processes
and their developmental policies and measures.
Where cross-cutting climate change responses are
called for, this policy provides for their inclusion in,
and consideration by, the relevant National, Provincial
and/or Local planning regime as well as coherent
alignment with the relevant policies and legislation.

4.2 Strategic Priorities

This White Paper sets out South Africa’s climate change
response strategy to achieve the National Climate
Change Response Objective in a manner consistent with
the principles and approach outlined above and which is
structured around the following strategic priorities:

¢ Risk reduction and management — prioritise near-
term adaptation interventions that address immediate
and observed threats to the economy, ecosystem
services and the health and well-being of South
Africans while researching and developing short-,
medium- and longer-term climate resilience, risk and
vulnerability management policies and measures.

¢ Mitigation actions with significant outcomes —
prioritise cost effective and beneficial mitigation
policies, measures and interventions that significantly
contribute to the country’s deviation from the
GHG emission “business as usual trajectory” as
measured against a benchmark “peak, plateau and
decline” GHG emission trajectory where GHG
emissions peak between 2020 and 2025, plateau
for approximately a decade and begin declining in
absolute terms thereafter.

¢ Sectoral responses — prioritise, in accordance with
the provisions of this policy, the requirement for all key
actors, organisations or participants in relevant sectors
or sub-sectors to prepare, submit, implement, monitor
and report the implementation of detailed climate
change response strategies and action plans that
clearly articulate their roles, responsibilities, policies,
measures, and interventions or actions to contribute
to the achievement of the National Climate Change
Response Objective in a measurable way.

¢ Policy and regulatory alignment — firstly, prioritise
interventions already envisaged by national policies,
legislation or strategies that have climate change
co-benefits, particularly those that also contribute
  

towards the national priorities of job creation,

poverty alleviation or have other positive socio-
economic benefits. Secondly, review existing national
policies, legislation or strategies, with a view to
optimising and maximising the climate change co-
benefits of their interventions. Thirdly, integrate
into the relevant existing or new policies, legislation
or strategies those climate change response
interventions that stimulate new economic activities
as well as those that improve the efficiency and
competitive advantage of existing activities.

Integrated planning — prioritise the mainstreaming
of climate change considerations and responses
into all relevant sector, national, provincial and
local planning regimes such as, but not limited
to, the Industrial Policy Action Plan, Integrated
Resource Plan for Electricity Generation, Provincial
Growth and Development Plans, and Integrated
Development Plans.

Informed decision-making and planning —
prioritise research, systemic observation, knowledge
generation, information management and early
warning systems that increase our ability to measure
and predict climate change and the implications of
its adverse effects on the economy, society and the
environment.

 

Technology research, development and innovation
— prioritise cooperation and the promotion of
research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation,
lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies,
practices and processes for employment by existing or
new sectors or sub-sectors.

Facilitated behaviour change — prioritise the use
of incentives and disincentives, including regulatory,
economic and fiscal measures, to promote behaviour
change towards a lower-carbon society and economy.

Behaviour change through choice — prioritise
education, training and public awareness programmes
to build the general public’s awareness of climate
change so as to empower all South Africans to make
informed choices that contribute to an economy and
society that is resilient to climate change.

Resource mobilisation — prioritise the development
of comprehensive resource and __ investment
mobilisation strategies, capacities, mechanisms or
instruments that support and enable implementation
of climate change responses at the scale required,
including, but not limited to, public and private financial
resources, incentives, non-market and market-based
instruments, technical cooperation and partnership
agreements, and technology transfers at domestic,
sub-regional, regional, and international levels.

5. ADAPTATION

5.1 Overall approach

All states in the Southern African sub-region face the
challenges of rural and urban poverty, limited water or
access to water resources, food insecurity, and other
development challenges. Thus, although countries of the
sub-region may have differing developmental priorities, they
often face similar risks due to climate change and may also
have similar adaptation needs. South Africa will therefore
strive to develop climate change adaptation strategies based
on risk and vulnerability reduction, in collaboration with its
neighbours where appropriate, and seek to share resources,
technology and learning to coordinate a regional response.
A regional approach that achieves climate resilience will
have significant socio-economic benefits for South Africa,
including a smaller risk of unmanaged regional migration.

A leading international assessment of the effects of climate
change on the global economy, the Stern Review, estimates
that damages from unmitigated climate change could range
between 5% and 20% of global Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) annually by 2100. In the absence of effective
adaptation responses, such levels of damages would certainly
threaten and even reverse many development gains made in
South Africa.

Future climate trends are uncertain and the uncertainty
rises steeply over the longer-term. Objectives for adaptation
must therefore be able to adjust to changing circumstances
and time-frames. For this reason, South Africa needs to plan
flexibly for a wide range of possible responses over the
medium- to long-term. We also need focused monitoring
and evaluation systems to update our knowledge of how
rapidly the change is occurring and the effectiveness of
adaptation responses. Section |2 contains more information
about these monitoring and evaluation systems.

A key feature of adaptation responses is that they have
a much stronger local context than do mitigation
responses and their benefits may appear much faster and
are often more tangible, such as an improvement in local
environmental quality, for instance. Effective adaptation
responses can also potentially create many jobs,
particularly “green jobs”, and could contribute significantly
to sustainable development goals. Well planned adaptation
responses can thus be effectively integrated with
sustainable development policies.

Effective planning and coordination of an integrated
adaptation response will require:

. Early warning and forecasting for disaster risk
reduction.

° Medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to
identify potential resource challenges well in advance.

° Long-term climate projections that define the range
of future climate conditions.

These need to be reinforced by research, capacity
development, and technology development, and to respond
to the needs of disaster risk reduction in the short-term,
and integrated resource and development planning in the
medium- and long-term.

Government departments have begun working on sectoral
adaptation responses, and these include job creation and
growth strategies, especially in the green economy, as well
as the protection and support of vulnerable groups. As a
first step in ensuring that appropriate adaptation responses
are mainstreamed into sectoral plans, a sub-committee
of the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change
(IGCCC) will be established to perform climate risk
analyses on all sectoral plans, informed by the various
sectoral adaptation responses, within two years of the
publication of this Policy, this process will result in —

* The identification and prioritisation of key short- and
medium-term adaptation interventions that must be
addressed in sector plans; and

* The identification of adaptation responses that
require coordination between specific sectors and/
or departments.

Using the results of this analysis, adaptation strategies will
be integrated into sectoral plans, including:

* The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as
reconciliation strategies for particular catchments
and water supply systems.

* The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture.

* The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as
well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local
bioregional plans.

* The Department of Health Strategic Plan.

* The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of
Sustainable Human Settlements.

° National Framework for Disaster Risk Management
  

In addition to a refinement of top-down approaches,
developing more detailed bottom-up approaches informed
by the responses of local communities and local government
will deliver results with a higher degree of confidence than
is currently possible.

5.2 Water

South Africa is a water scarce country with a highly variable
climate and has one of the lowest run-offs in the world —a
situation that is likely to be significantly exacerbated by the
effects of climate change. Uniquely, South Africa shares four
of its major river systems with six neighbouring countries.
These four shared catchments amount to approximately
60% of South Africa’s surface area and approximately 40%
of the average total river flow.

Based on current projections South Africa will exceed the
limits of economically viable land-based water resources
by 2050. The adequate supply of water for many areas can
be sustained only if immediate actions are taken to stave
off imminent shortages. The water sector must balance
the allocation of limited water resources amongst major
users (agriculture, domestic urban use and industry), whilst
addressing the need to ensure fair access to water for
all South Africa’s people as well as a sufficient ecological
allocation to maintain the integrity of ecosystems and
thereby the services they provide.

Although Government has provided basic water services
to an estimated additional nine million people since 1994,
they are mostly in urban areas. In many rural areas, lack of
reticulated water and sanitation means that people rely on
generally poorly managed local resources such as ground
water, springs and rivers that are vulnerable to pollution and
drought. Poor communities who are dependent on natural
water resources cannot control the quality of their water
or store the water supply in bulk.

While there is a degree of uncertainty as to the net effects
of climate change on water availability, rainfall is expected
to become more variable, with an increase of extreme
events such as flooding and droughts resulting in a much
more variable runoff regime. Downscaled climate modelling
suggests that the western and interior parts of the country
are likely to become drier, and the eastern parts of the
country wetter. Increased rainfall intensity will exacerbate
scouring in rivers and sedimentation in dams, potentially
impacting on water supply and treatment infrastructure.

 

Higher temperatures, combined with higher carbon dioxide
levels, will contribute to increased growth of algae as well as
faster evaporation rates negatively impacting water resources.

Water availability is a
vulnerability and negative impacts on the availability of
water will be felt by people, ecosystems and the economy.
As a result, climate change poses significant additional risks

key climate change-related

for water security, which in turn has knock-on effects on
those sectors highly reliant on water such as agriculture,
electricity generation as well as some mining and industrial
activities. Thus, this set of vulnerabilities must be considered
and integrated into both short- and medium-term water
sector planning approaches.

In the short term, the development of a climate change
response for the water sector through the National
Water Resource Strategy plays a key role in government's
Integrated Water Resource Planning process and will
inform the ongoing maintenance of the water balance
reconciliation strategies for water management areas that
have recently been developed for water supply systems for
up to 75% of the country’s population, and the areas which
together generate well over 80% of the national GDP.

In the medium to long term, the Water for Growth and
Development Framework, which has a 2030 planning
horizon, aims to balance the critical role of water in terms
of both poverty alleviation (ensuring the constitutional
right to a reliable and safe water supply) and economic
development (be it for domestic, industry, mining, agricultural
or forestry use).Water vulnerability and response must also
be adequately factored into this framework document.

A two-pronged approach will be followed in which, firstly,
in the short-term, climate change is used as the catalyst
for addressing urgent short comings in the water sector
and implementing effective, efficient and sustainable water
resources and services management measures. Secondly,
a long-term strategic focus on planning, adaptation and
the smart implementation of new concepts and proactive
approaches to managing water resources. To this end, the
key elements of the National Climate Change Response
Policy for the water sector include:

5.2.1 Integrating climate change considerations in the
short-, medium- and long-term water planning
processes across relevant sectors such as agriculture,
industry, economic development, health, science and
technology.

7
  

5.2.2 Sustaining state-of-the-art, water-related research
and capacity development in all aspects of climate
change in order to ensure the availability of relevant
high quality, complete and current data, and tools
with which to analyse the data.

5.2.3. Ensuring that water adaptation measures are
managed from a regional perspective given the
trans-boundary nature of our major rivers.

5.2.4 Implementing best catchment and water management
Practices to ensure the greatest degree of water
security and resource protection under changing
climatic conditions and, in particular, investment in
water conservation and water demand management.

5.2.5 Exploring new and unused resources, particularly
groundwater, re-use of effluent, and desalination.

5.2.6 Reducing the vulnerability and enhancement of the
resilience to water-related impacts of climate change
in communities and sectors at greatest risk

5.2.7 Providing human, legal, regulatory, institutional,
governance and financial resources and capacity to
deal with the long-term effects of climate change

5.2.8 Undertaking focused monitoring and research in
order to ensure the efficacy of water adaptation
approaches over the long-term.

5.3 Agriculture and commercial forestry

Climate change significantly impacts agriculture and
commercial forestry and they have significant potential
for adaptation. Globally, agriculture is a key contributor to
climate change, being responsible for about 14% of all GHG
emissions. In both the agriculture and commercial forestry
sectors synergy and overlap exists between adaptation
and mitigation measures, and climate-resilient sectoral
plans have the potential to directly address the plight of
those most impacted by climate change — the rural poor.
Furthermore, in these sectors climate resilience addresses
issues of strategic national importance: food security, water,
health, and land reform.Agriculture is the largest consumer
of water (through irrigation) and is vulnerable to changes in
water availability,increased water pollution (particularly from
toxic algal or bacterial blooms) and soil erosion from more
intense rainfall events and increased evapotranspiration.
Under-resourced, small-scale and subsistence farmers are
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

At the same time, conventional, commercial input-intensive
agriculture has a range of negative environmental, social
and economic externalities, which increasingly render it
an unsustainable model. However, commercial agriculture
remains a significant contributor to GDP and employment.
Its full contribution, with multipliers, comprises up to 12%
of GDP and 30% of national employment. Crop failures can
therefore have a significant economic impact. A climate-
resilient agricultural response depends on the recognition
that agriculture should provide not only food, but also a
range of other environmental and socio-economic benefits.
The appropriate
agriculture techniques and models could reverse the present

use of small-scale labour-intensive
decrease in agricultural jobs; contribute to empowerment
goals; promote food security; conserve soil quality and
structure; and contribute to biodiversity.

Modelling of climate change scenarios is vital to informing
land-use planning decisions in agriculture that determine
the mix of livestock and crop cultivation, as well as the types
of crops that are likely to be commercially viable.

Commercial forestry in the form of alien plantations
reduces streamflow and so impacts scarce water resources.
It also reduces biodiversity. However, plantations function
as carbon sinks that reduce the amount of GHGs in the
atmosphere.

To build resilience to climate change, the priorities for
agriculture and commercial forestry are to:

5.3.1 Integrate agriculture and forestry into climate-
resilient rural development planning to address
job creation, food security and livelihoods with a
particular emphasis on building climate resilience
through leveraging synergies between adaptation and
mitigation.

5.3.2 Using the results of available risk and vulnerability
studies, develop and update short-, medium- and
long-term adaptation scenarios to identify climate-
resilient land-uses. This will support the agricultural
industry's proactive exploit new
agricultural opportunities, new areas and new crops
and it will reduce the impacts of climate change on
existing agricultural potential.

efforts to

5.3.3. Invest in and improve research into water,
nutrient and soil conservation technologies and

techniques, climate-resistant crops and livestock,
  

as well as agricultural production, ownership, and
financing models to promote the development of
“climate-smart agriculture” that lowers agricultural
emissions, is more resilient to climate changes, and
boosts agricultural yields.

5.3.4 Use early warning systems to give timely warnings
of adverse weather and possibly related pests and
disease occurrence. This will also provide up-to-
date information and decision support tools to
assess the vulnerability of farmers and inform farm
management decisions.

5.3.5 Invest in education and awareness programmes in
rural areas and link these to agricultural extension
activities to enable both subsistence and commercial
producers to understand, respond and adapt to the
challenges of climate change.

5.4 Health

The South African health sector is one of the five key
priorities of government.A significant proportion of South
Africans, and in particular the poor, already have serious
and complex health challenges compounded by poor living
conditions. These include amongst the world’s highest rates
of tuberculosis and HIV infection. In particular parts of the
country, the coverage of vector-borne diseases like malaria,
rift valley fever and schistosomiasis may spread due to
climate change, requiring a concomitant expansion of public
health initiatives to combat these diseases. The links between
the environment, food security and the infectious profiles of
communities and regions have been well established.

Within this context, the extreme weather events and
increased climate variability associated with climate change
provides a number of significant compounding factors that
negatively affect the health and resilience of vulnerable
communities:

* The negative impacts of climate change on the
socio-economic standing of the most vulnerable
communities, and the consequences in terms of food
security and the nutritional status of individuals within
these communities threatens to further undermine
their resistance to diseases such as HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis.

é The links between weather and disease are well
established — for instance, studies have shown a

 

strong association between extreme weather events
such as droughts and flooding and the incidence of
water borne diseases such as cholera.

. Furthermore, direct physical temperature stresses
pose particular risks for children, the elderly and
socio-economically vulnerable communities. South
African data from the past four decades indicates an
increase in the number of hotter days and nights and
therefore an increased risk of casualties from heat
stress.

* Women, as primary care-givers, are put under
additional strain looking after sick and elderly
household members whilst maintaining a household.
This leaves them less time to earn a livelihood putting
cyclical pressure on them as they often neglect their
own health in prioritising the health of others.

* In densely populated urban areas, air pollution
resulting primarily from the burning of fossil fuels
may have serious health effects. Whilst South Africa’s
air quality is generally good, stagnant air episodes in
cities can create extremely poor air quality conditions
and there are indications that climate change may
increase the number and intensity of such events.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will integrate
climate change considerations into health sector plans to:

5.4.1 Reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases and
improve air quality through reducing ambient
particulate matter, ozone, and sulphur dioxide
concentrations by legislative and other measures
to ensure full compliance with National Ambient
Air Quality Standards by 2020. In this regard, the
use of legislative and other measures that also have
the co-benefit of reducing GHG emissions will be
prioritised. Progress in this regard will be published
on the South African Air Quality Information System
(SAAQIS).

5.4.2 Recognising that the nutritional status of individuals
is key to building resilience to environmental
health threats, ensure that food security and sound
nutritional policies form part of an integrated
approach to health adaptation strategies.

5.4.3. Develop and roll-out public awareness campaigns on
the health risks of high temperatures and appropriate
responses including improved ventilation and

19
  

a

promotion of behaviours that minimise exposure to
high temperatures, namely “avoidance behaviour”.

5.4.4 Design and implement “Heat-Health” action plans
including plans in respect of emergency medical

services, improved  climate-sensitive disease
surveillance and control, safe water and improved
sanitation.

5.4.5 Strengthen information and knowledge of linkages
between disease and climate change through research.

5.4.6 Develop a health data-capturing system that records
data both at spatial and temporal scales and that
ensures that information collected can be imported
into multiple-risk systems such as the South African
Risk and Vulnerability Atlas (SARVA).

5.4.7 Improve the bio-safety of the current malaria
control strategy. Although the current strategy,
which includes the use of the persistent organic
pollutant, DDT, has proven effective in reducing the
incidence of malaria, there are significant concerns
about its long-term impacts on environmental and
human health.

5.4.8 Strengthen the awareness programme on malaria
and cholera outbreaks.

5.5 Biodiversity and ecosystems

Climate change will compound the pressures on
already stressed ecosystems that have resulted from the
unsustainable use and inadequate management of many
of South Africa’s ecosystems and so potentially reduce
the quantity and quality of the services that ecosystems
currently provide. These critical services underpin South
Africa’s socio-economic activities. Stressed ecosystems
will compromise one of the key responses available to
the country to adapt to climate change: using ecosystem
services to help society adapt to climate change, known as
»ecosystem-based adaptation’.

Although South Africa has a conceptual understanding
of the possible impacts of climate change on many of its
key biodiversity assets, a comprehensive and quantitative
evaluation of various climate change, and climate change
impact, scenarios has yet to be undertaken for all significant
ecosystems, especially with respect to the services they
provide.

Notwithstanding the uncertainty alluded to above, projected
climate change impacts on biodiversity assets are likely to
include although are not limited to:

* Roughly 30% of endemic terrestrial species in South
Africa may be at an increasingly high risk of extinction
by the latter half of this century if climate change is
not mitigated.

° Marine ecosystems and species are at risk from
changes in water temperature, ocean acidification and
from changes in ocean currents such as West Coast
upwelling and Agulhas current strengthening. Change
in South Africa's marine and coastal environment is
already being observed and this change has already
had significant impacts on the fisheries sector and
on the local economy of small-scale and subsistence
fishing communities along the West Coast.

. Changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures, and
rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could shift
the distribution of South African terrestrial biomes
with many implications for species diversity, ecosystem
Processes such as wildfires, and critical ecosystem
services such as water yield and grazing biomass.

° Increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events will
influence runoff quality and quantity in complex
ways, significantly affecting the marine and estuarine
environment. Reduced water flow will increase the
salinity of estuaries, affecting the breeding grounds
and nursery areas of many marine species. Coastal
estuaries will also be vulnerable to long-term sea-
level rise.

* Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide has poorly known
direct effects on ecosystems. It may be increasing the
cover of shrubs and trees in Grassland and Savannah
Biomes,with mixed effects on biodiversity and possible
positive implications for carbon sequestration.

* Additional stresses to biodiversity resulting from
climate change include wildfire frequency (which
appears to already show climate change-related
increases in the Fynbos Biome), and the prevalence of
invasive alien species. These stresses combined with
reduced and fragmented habitats will further increase
the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will integrate
climate change into the management of biodiversity and
ecosystem services as follows:
 55:1

55.2

5.5.3

5.5.4

5:55

5.5.6

5:57.

 

Strengthen biodiversity management and research
institutions so that they can monitor, assess and
respond effectively to existing anthropogenic
pressures together with the additional pressures that
climate change presents.

Conserve, rehabilitate and restore natural systems
that improve resilience to climate change impacts or
that reduce impacts. For example, mangrove forests
reduce storm surge impacts and riparian vegetation
and wetland ecosystems reduce the potential impact
of floods. Opportunities to conserve biodiversity
and extend the conservation estate through the
development of carbon off-set programmes will be
actively developed, such as those presented by the
preservation of Spekboom as part of the Eastern
Cape Thicket Biome.

Prioritise impact assessments and adaptation planning
that takes into account the full range of possible
climate outcomes, in conjunction with plausible
scenarios of other stresses.

Prioritise climate change research into marine and
terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services,
and institute effective monitoring to enhance the
understanding and forecasting of critical future
threats. Monitoring efforts at national and sub-
national scale, supported by experimental studies
that quantify future risks to biodiversity and that
improve projections of impacts, will help to design
and refine adaptation responses.

Enhance existing programmes to combat the spread
of terrestrial and marine alien and invasive species,
especially in cases where such infestations worsen
the impacts of climate change.

Expand the protected area network (in line with the
National Protected Area Expansion Strategy) where
it improves climate change resilience, and manage
threatened biomes, ecosystems, and species in ways
that will minimise the risks of species extinction.
A regulatory framework to support investment
in conservation or land rehabilitation as a way
of offsetting the environmental impacts of new
property developments will be explored.

Encourage partnerships for effective management
of areas not under formal protection, especially

 

critical

freshwater ecosystem priority
biodiversity areas, ecological support areas and

threatened ecosystems.

areas,

5.5.8 In the medium-term, expand existing gene banks to
conserve critically endangered species that show

increasing vulnerability to climate change trends.

5.6 Human Settlements — Urban Settlements

More than 60% of South Africa’s population live in urban
areas, which cover only 1.5% of South Africa’s surface area.
The average growth rate for urban areas is consistently
higher than the population growth rate. Urban areas are
functionally more efficient, with lower per capita costs of
services and land requirements for human settlement, but
urban areas consume more resources and have an impact
far beyond their urban boundaries. Urban sprawl reduces
biodiversity and it pollutes land, water and air. Informal
settlements are vulnerable to environmental and health
risks because dwellings are in areas prone to disasters and
that lack basic services.

Urban human settlements face the following climate change
challenges:

. Climate change may exacerbate the problems caused
by poor urban management. For example, poor
storm water drainage systems and urban-induced
soil erosion result in flash flooding. Increased storm
intensity due to climate change would exacerbate
such problems.

. Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change
because they are slow to adapt to changes in the
environment and they have entrenched dependencies
on specific delivery mechanisms for critical services.

* The effective management of the interface between
urban residents and their surrounding environment
producing sustainable social-ecological systems needs
to the addressed. Similarly the concept of climate
resilience in the context of urban social-ecological
systems needs to be further developed.

* South Africa’s cities still reflect apartheid planning
with the poorest communities tending to live far
away from services and employment. Our cities are
relatively spread out and these two factors contribute
to increased transport emissions.

2|
  

a 22

* Water demand in urban centres is growing rapidly,
placing undue stress on water supply systems.
Investment in waste water treatment works has not
remained in line with the growth in demand and use.

s Informal settlements are vulnerable to floods and
fires, exacerbated by their location in flood- or
ponding-prone areas and on sand dunes; inferior
building materials; and inadequate road access for
emergency vehicles.

* Cities and dense urban settlements consume large
amounts of energy.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will:

5.6.1 Investigate how to leverage opportunities presented
by urban densification to build climate-resilient urban
infrastructure and promote behavioural change as
part of urban planning and growth management.

5.6.2 In the implementation of low-cost housing, ensure
access to affordable lower-carbon public transport
systems, incorporate thermal efficiency into designs
and use climate-resilient technologies.

5.6.3. Develop effective information, monitoring and
assessment tools to evaluate the resilience of our
cities and towns to climate change and assist urban
planners in identifying priorities for scaling-up
climate change responses. Strengthen and enhance
decision support tools and systems such as the
Toolkit for Integrated Planning and develop geographic
information systems that include, but not limited
to, asset management components for public
infrastructure.

5.6.4 Encourage and develop water-sensitive urban design
to capture water in the urban landscape and to
minimise pollution, erosion and disturbance. Urban
infrastructure planning must account for water
supply constraints and impacts of extreme weather-
related events.

5.6.5 Acknowledging the current modelling limitations,
encourage and support the appropriate down-
scaling of climate models to provincial and, where
possible, metropolitan and district levels to provide
climate information at a scale that can be integrated
into medium- and long-term spatial development
plans and information systems.

5.6.6 Ensure that land-use zoning regulations are enforced
and that urban land-use planning considers the
impacts of climate change and the need to sustain
ecosystem services when considering settlements
and infrastructure development proposals.

5.7 Human Settlements — Rural Settlements

Over nineteen million, or 39%, of South Africans live in
rural areas. Eighty percent of rural areas are commercial
farming areas with low population densities, and 20% are
former “homelands” where the agricultural sector has been
undermined, settlements are often densely populated, and
people are poor and largely reliant on urban remittances
and social welfare for their livelihoods. Small-scale and
homestead food production are practiced in rural areas
on both high potential and marginal agricultural land, with
roughly |.3 million small-scale farm units. Seventy percent of
the country’s poorest households live on small-scale farms
and few of them produce enough food to feed themselves
throughout the year.

Rural human settlements face the following climate change
challenges:

. Small-scale and subsistence food production is
particularly vulnerable to climate variability, relying
mostly on dryland food production with limited
capital to invest in soil fertilisation, seed and weed,
pest and disease control.

° Climate change, in particular changes in production
systems and climate change-related damage and crop
failures, is likely to negatively affect employment in
rural areas.

° Spatial planning needs to address historical inequalities
in land distribution without compromising the ability
of the agricultural sector to contribute to food
security.

. Rural communities with the highest dependence
on natural water sources are in KwaZulu-Natal,
the Eastern Cape and Limpopo. The former two
will probably experience more flooding and water
contamination. In addition to these, Limpopo will
probably experience more droughts. These are areas
with some of the poorest communities and under-
resourced municipalities with limited capacity and
skills to adapt to changing conditions.
  

é Rural areas are under-represented in the climate
monitoring network despite the fact that they are
likely to be the soonest and most greatly negatively
affected by climate change.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will:

5.7.1 Educate subsistence and small-scale farmers on
the potential risks of climate change, and support
them to develop adaptation strategies with on-farm
demonstration and experimentation. Adaptation
strategies will include conservation agriculture
practices including water harvesting and crop
rotation, and will prioritise indigenous knowledge
and local adaptive responses.

5.7.2. Empower local communities, particularly women
who are often primary producers, in the process of
designing and implementing adaptation strategies.

5.7.3. Design and implement economic and livelihood
diversification programmes in rural areas.

5.7.4. Within the country’s research and development
system, prioritise technologies for climate change
adaptation within rural including low

water-use irrigation systems, improved roll-out

areas,

of rainwater harvesting strategies, and drought-
resistant seed varieties.

5.7.5 Target adaptation programmes to build resilience
among the most vulnerable sections of the rural
population and ensure that disaster management
architecture includes the provision of safety nets
for rural communities most vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change. This includes enhancing
their knowledge of sustainable environmental
conditions and optimising the ecosystem services
that these provide.

5.8 Human Settlements — Coastal Settlements

Coastal human settlements are the most vulnerable to an
increase in sea-level rise due to climate change. Coastal areas
provide habitation, work, and recreation to approximately
40% of the South African people. A significant proportion
of South Africa’s metropolitan areas, including numerous
towns and smaller settlements, are situated along the
coastline. These areas also host high volumes of local and
international tourists annually.A network of infrastructural

 

installations and communication links along the coast, built
by public and private enterprises, service the needs of the
inhabitants, tourists and other entities in the coastal zone.
The attraction of lifestyle and development opportunities in
coastal area is leading to significant migration to the coast,
with additional settlements and services in areas that are
not immune to the impacts of climate change.

The 3,650 km South African coastline is generally exposed
to moderate to strong wave action and provides little
natural shelter to storms from the sea.With climate change
expected to increase both the frequency and intensity of
storms, the South African coastline will become increasingly
vulnerable to storm surges, coastal erosion, sea-level rise
and extreme weather events. A continual assessment of
coastal defences, particularly at harbours, estuaries and
lagoons, and along low-lying coastal land, will be needed to
reduce damage in high risk areas.

In addition to the climate change impacts listed for urban
and rural areas above, further impacts for coastal areas
include:

. Flooding and coastal erosion that result in the loss of
coastal infrastructure (including breakwaters, roads
and public amenities), habitat and ecosystem goods
and services. Predicted rises in sea level may further
exacerbate these impacts.

. Increased frequency and intensity of coastal storms,
which includes seasonal cyclone activity on the east
coast. Estuaries are particularly vulnerable.

Increased coastal development and inappropriate land and
catchment management will exacerbate these impacts.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will:

5.8.1 Ensure that national, provincial and municipal coastal
management plans incorporate relevant climate
information and geographic information systems
and adopt a risk-based approach to planning that
anticipates the consequences of the continued
migration of communities into high risk coastal
areas.

5.8.2 Take account of the potential impact of sea-level rise
and intense weather events, such as storm surges,
on infrastructure development and investment in
coastal areas, particularly in terms of the location
of the high-water mark and coastal set-back lines

23
  

a 24

that demarcate the areas in which development is
prohibited or controlled. Government will review
and amend the legislation to deal with adjustments
of coastal set-back lines that affect the status of
existing public and private infrastructure.

5.8.3 Protect and rehabilitate natural systems that act
as important coastal defences, such as mangrove
swamps, offshore reefs and coastal dunes.

5.8.4 Develop Disaster Risk Management plans that take
into account the potential consequences of climate
change along the coast, particularly the increased
incidence of extreme weather events.

5.8.5 Support ongoing research to determine the impacts
of climate change on artisanal fishing communities
and livelihoods in coastal areas that are directly
connected to coastal and marine resources and
identify appropriate responses.

5.9 Disaster risk reduction and management

Disaster risk reduction and management are short-term
adaptations to climate change because both address
vulnerability to climate change-related impacts. Resilience to
climate change-related extreme events, such as heat waves,
floods, droughts, wildfires and storm surges, will be the basis
for South Africa’s future approach to disaster management.
Extreme weather events often cross country borders and
impact on the region as a whole. As such a region-wide
approach to disaster management is often needed.

South Africa’s Disaster Management Act sets out a
comprehensive approach to disaster management and it
identifies the roles and responsibilities of key institutions
and disaster management agencies. In addition, the Act
establishes a National Disaster Management Centre whose
role is to address disaster prevention, coordinate disaster
management agencies and capacity across government and
to ensure that critical information is disseminated speedily.

Climate change will require more effective disaster
management to deal with the increased number of extreme
weather events. The increase in extreme events will strain
public resources due to the need to declare and support
disaster areas in an immediate crisis as well as during long-
term recovery.

In response to these challenges, South Africa will:

5.9.1 Continue to develop and improve its early warning
systems for weather and climate (especially severe
weather events) and pest infestation events and to
ensure that these warnings reach potentially affected
populations timeously. To this end, we will investigate
and implement plans to use the mass media and
appropriate
technologies to alert vulnerable populations.

information and communication

5.9.2 Seek to collaborate with our neighbouring states
to share early warning systems with regional
applications and benefits.

5.9.3. Continue to promote the development of Risk
and Vulnerability Service Centres at universities,
which will, in turn, support resource-constrained
municipalities.

5.9.4 Facilitate increased use of seasonal climate forecasts
among key stakeholders such as those in the water
and agricultural sectors.

5.9.5 Maintain, update and enhance the SARVA as a tool
that provinces and municipalities may use to inform
their climate change adaptation planning.

5.9.6 Collaborate with social networks such as community
organisations, non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), women and farmers’ organisations, and the
Adaptation Network to help raise awareness and to
transfer technology and build capacity.

5.9.7. Develop mechanisms for the poor to recover after
disasters, including micro-insurance.
  

6. MITIGATION

6.1 Overall approach to mitigation

South Africa’s approach to mitigation is informed by two
contexts:first, its contribution as a responsible global citizen to
the international effort to curb global emissions; and second,
its successful management of the development and poverty
eradication challenges it faces. The National Climate Change
Response is intended to promote adaptation and mitigation
measures that will make development more sustainable, both
in socio-economic and environmental terms.

South Africa recognises that stabilisation of GHG
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system will require effective international co-operation. We
therefore regard mitigation as a national priority and are
committed to actively engaging in international negotiations
under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, which South
Africa has ratified.

As a responsible global citizen and as a global citizen with
moral as well as legal obligations under the UNFCCC and its
Kyoto Protocol, South Africa is committed to contributing
its fair share to global GHG mitigation efforts in order
to keep the temperature increase well below 2°C. In this
regard, on 6 December 2009, the President announced
that South Africa will implement mitigation actions that
will collectively result in a 34% and a 42% deviation below
its ,,Business As Usual’ emissions growth trajectory by
2020 and 2025 respectively. In accordance with Article 4.7
of the UNFCCC, the extent to which this outcome can
be achieved depends on the extent to which developed
countries meet their commitment to provide financial,
capacity-building, technology development and technology
transfer support to developing countries. With financial,
technology and capacity-building support, this level of effort
will enable South Africa’s GHG emissions to peak between
2020 and 2025, plateau for approximately a decade and
decline in absolute terms thereafter.

To this end, the key elements in the overall approach to
mitigation include:

6.1.1 Setting the performance benchmark — Using the
National GHG Emissions Trajectory Range, against
which the collective outcome of all mitigation
actions will be measured. Section 6.4 contains more

information about the emissions trajectory.

Identifying desired sectoral mitigation contribut-

ions — Defining desired emission reduction

6.1.3
6.1.4
6.1.5

 

outcomes for each sector and sub-sector of the
economy within two years of the publication of
this policy-based on an in-depth assessment of
the mitigation potential, best available mitigation
options, science, evidence and a full assessment of
the costs and benefits. Where appropriate, these
desired emission reduction outcomes will be
cascaded to individual company or entity level;

Defining Carbon Budgets for significant GHG
emitting sectors and/or sub-sectors — Adopting
a carbon budget approach to provide for flexibility
and least-cost mechanisms for companies in
relevant sectors and/or sub-sectors. The initial
Carbon Budgets for significant GHG emitting
sectors and/or sub-sectors will be drawn up
and adopted within two years of the publication
of this policy and revised as required based on
monitoring and evaluation results, technological
advances or new science, evidence and information.
A mechanism and process to translate the Carbon
Budgets for each relevant sector and/or sub-sector
into company level desired emission reduction
outcomes will be developed and implemented
within three years of the publication of this
policy for companies above a minimum emissions
threshold. Section 6.5 contains more information
about the carbon budget approach.

Mitigation Plans — Requiring companies and
economic sectors or sub-sectors for whom
desired emission reduction outcomes have been
established to prepare and submit mitigation plans
that set out how they intend to achieve the desired
emission reduction outcomes.

The use of different types of mitigation
approaches, policies, measures and actions —
Developing and implementing a wide range and mix
of different types of mitigation approaches, policies,
measures and actions that optimise the mitigation
outcomes as well as job creation and other
sustainable developmental benefits. This optimal
mix of mitigation actions will be developed to
achieve the defined desired emission reduction
outcomes for each sector and sub-sector of the
economy by ensuring that actions are specifically
tailored to the best available solutions and other
relevant conditions related to the specific sector,
sub-sector or organisation concerned;

25
  

a 26

Using the market — Deploying a range of
economic instruments to support the system of
desired emissions reduction outcomes, including
the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic
incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions
offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms
for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies
or entities where a carbon budget approach has
been selected.

6.1.7. Monitoring and evaluation — Establishing a
national system of data collection to provide
detailed, complete, up-to-date
emissions data in the form of a Greenhouse Gas

accurate and

Inventory and a Monitoring and Evaluation System
to support the analysis of the impact of mitigation
measures. Section 6.7 contains more information
about emissions data collection and section 12
expands on the proposed Climate Change Response
Monitoring and Evaluation System.

6.2 South Africa’s emissions

South Africa has relatively high emissions for a developing
country, measured either per capita or by GHG intensity
(emissions per unit of GDP). By any measure, South Africa
is a significant emitter of GHGs.

The energy intensity of the South African economy, largely
due to the significance of mining and minerals processing
in the economy and our coal-intensive energy system, has
resulted in an emissions profile that differs substantially
from that of other developing countries at a similar stage
of development as measured by the Human Development
Index. Since coal is the most emissions-intensive energy
carrier, South Africas economy is very emissions-intensive.
Furthermore, emissions from land-use change (primarily
deforestation) contribute a significantly smaller share to our
emission profile than for many other developing countries.
In 2000, average energy use emissions for developing
countries constituted 49% of total emissions, whereas South
Africas energy use emissions constituted just under 80% of
total emissions. Even in some fast-developing countries with
a similar reliance on coal for energy, energy use emissions
are lower than South Africa.

In terms of South Africas latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory
(base year 2000), the majority of South Africas energy
electricity generation, which

emissions arose from

constituted around half of South Africa’s energy emissions
and just under 40% of total emissions in 2000.Transportation
and energy used in industry contributed just under 10%
each of total emissions and industrial process emissions
constituted around 14% of total emissions. Emissions from
agriculture and land-use change in South Africa constitute
only around 5% of emissions, compared to an average of
44% in developing countries as a whole.

6.3 Mitigation potential

Currently available analyses indicate that, unchecked by
climate mitigation action, South Africa’s emissions could
grow rapidly by as much as fourfold by 2050.The majority of
South Africa’s emissions arise from energy supply (electricity
and liquid fuels) and use (mining, industry and transport),
and mitigation actions with the largest emission reduction
potential focus on these areas.The cost of mitigation actions
varies significantly, and published analyses of these costs is
likely to require further refinement, especially at sectoral,
sub-sectoral and individual organisation levels.

Unlike in other developing countries, South Africa has limited
opportunities to cut emissions by tackling deforestation, a
sector in which near-term emission reductions are more
easily achieved through regulatory policies and enforcement
type measures and are therefore relatively inexpensive.
While opportunities for mitigation of emissions from non-
energy sources do exist, large mitigation contributions
will have to come from reduced emissions from energy
generation and use. The main opportunities for mitigation
consist of energy efficiency, demand management and
moving to a less emissions-intensive energy mix, with
consequent economic benefits of improved efficiency and
competitiveness as well as incentivising economic growth in
sectors with lower energy intensities.

Policy decisions on new infrastructure investments must
consider climate change impacts to avoid the lock-in of
emissions-intensive technologies into the future. However,
in the short-term, due to the stock and stage in the
economic lifecycle of existing infrastructure and plant, the
most promising mitigation options are primarily energy
efficiency and demand side management, coupled with
increasing investment in a renewable energy programme
in the electricity sector. In addition, in the short term, the
emergence of bio-fuels and a suite of non-energy mitigation
options, such as afforestation, are also important.
  

A mix of economic instruments, including market-based
instruments such as carbon taxes and emissions trading
schemes, and incentives, complemented by appropriate
regulatory policy measures are essential to driving and
facilitating mitigation efforts and creating incentives for
mitigation actions across a wide range of key economic
sectors. Section 10.7 provides further details on the
application of market-based policy instruments.

In the medium-term, the mitigation options with the biggest
mitigation potential are:

* shifting to lower-carbon electricity generation

options;

* significant upscaling of energy efficiency applications,
especially industrial energy efficiency and energy
efficiency in public, commercial and_ residential
buildings and in transport; and

$ promoting transport-related interventions including
transport modal shifts (road to rail, private to public
transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g.
electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels.

. In the short and medium term, several other options
are available with a smaller mitigation potential,
including:

s carbon capture and storage in the synthetic fuels
industry;

‘ options for mitigating non-energy emissions in
agriculture and land-use; and

‘ transitioning the society and economy to more
sustainable consumption and production patterns.

In our long-term planning, information (nationally and
internationally) about the outcome of mitigation options,
technology development, and other new information, may
suggest additional mitigation actions.

This policy identifies or sets up processes to identify the
optimal combination of actions sufficient to meet the
National Climate Change Response Objective. Factors to
be considered include not only the mitigation potential,
the incremental and direct cost of measures, but also the
broader impact on socio-economic development indicators
(such as employment and income distribution), our
international competitiveness, the cost to poor households
and any negative consequences for key economic sectors.

 

6.4 The Benchmark National GHG Emissions
Trajectory Range

In 2008, in the context of South Africa’s moral and legal
obligation to make a fair contribution to the global
mitigation effort under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto
Protocol, Cabinet fully considered the Long Term Mitigation
Scenario study of the country’s mitigation potential. This led
to the announcement that South Africa’s emissions should
peak in the period from 2020 to 2025, remain stable for
around a decade, and decline thereafter in absolute terms.
The President confirmed this strategic policy direction at
the 2009 National Climate Summit and further detailed this
as a South African undertaking in the context of all legal
obligations under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol prior
to the international UNFCCC Climate Change Conference
in 2009 (see 6.1 above). This strategic policy direction and
international undertaking has informed a National GHG
Emissions Trajectory Range, projected to 2050, to be used
as the benchmark against which the efficacy of mitigation
action will be measured.

The benchmark National GHG Emissions Trajectory Range:

6.4.1 Reflects South Africa’s fair contribution to the global
effort to limit anthropogenic climate change to well
below a maximum of 20C above pre-industrial
levels.

6.4.2 Details the “peak, plateau and decline trajectory”
used as the initial benchmark against which the
efficacy of mitigation actions will be measured
(see the document published by the Department
of Environmental Affairs (DEA) in 2011 entitled
“Defining South Africa’s Peak, Plateau and Decline
Greenhouse Gas Emission Trajectory”). In summary:

- South Africa’s GHG emissions peak in the period
2020 to 2025 in a range with a lower limit of 398
Megatonnes (109 kg) (Mt) CO,-eq and upper
limits of 583 Mt CO,-eq and 614 Mt CO,-eq for
2020 and 2025 respectively.

- South Africa’s GHG emissions will plateau for up
to ten years after the peak within the range with
a lower limit of 398 Mt CO,-eq and upper limit of
614 Mt CO,-eq.

- From 2036 onwards, emissions will decline in
absolute terms to a range with lower limit of 212 Mt
CO,-eq and upper limit of 428 Mt CO,-eq by 2050.

Trajectory Range, which may be reviewed in the light

of monitoring and evaluation results, technological
advances or new science, evidence and information.

6.5 The Carbon Budget Approach

Recognising that due to the current emissions-intense
structure of the economy, many sectors require a flexible
mitigation approach, which enables the development and
use of lowest-cost options such as offset and other types
of market-based mechanisms. For such sectors, a Carbon
Budget (CB) approach is adopted that specifies desired
emission reduction outcomes consistent with the benchmark
national GHG emissions range trajectory.To this end, CBs will
be drawn up within two years of the publication of this policy
for relevant economic sectors and subsectors, particularly
in the major energy supply (electricity and liquid fuels) and
use (mining, industry and transport) sectors. These CBs will
be updated as required based on monitoring and evaluation
results, technological advances or new science, evidence and
information. The CBs will be released in conjunction with
the National Climate Change Response Monitoring and
Evaluation System, which includes an enhanced National
Greenhouse Gas Inventory process.

The CB process will identify an optimal combination
of mitigation actions at the least cost to-and with the
most sustainable development benefits for-the relevant
sector and national economy to enable and support the
achievement of the desired emission reduction outcomes
consistent with the benchmark National GHG Emissions
Trajectory Range. Government will actively consult with
industry and other key stakeholders in the development of
CBs and approaches, mechanisms and outcomes.

The process to draw up or to review the CBs will consist
of the following steps:

6.5.1 Review of the contributions making up the national
emissions trajectory informed by _ historical
emissions and trends and the most recent and best
available scientific evidence and information.

6.5.2 Identification of a portfolio of enabling mitigation
programmes and measures, including economy-
wide measures and instruments, such as a carbon
tax and incentives to industry and households, and
the financial resources available to support them.

6.5.3 Analysis of :

- current and future emissions trends by sector and
sub-sector,

- the timing, scale, cost and risk of different
mitigation actions for each economic sector and
sub-sector, and

- the economy-wide implications of mitigation
actions, in particular on jobs.

6.5.4 Development of desired emission reduction
outcomes for each sector and sub-sector of the
economy. These will include short-, medium- and
long-term CBs for sectors and sub-sectors where
a CB approach is relevant. In respect of significant
point-source emissions, the CBs will be cascaded
down to sub-sectors and, ultimately, companies

whose emissions are above a specified threshold.

6.5.5 Consultation with:

- The National Treasury, the Departments of Trade
and Industry and Economic Development on the
implementation of fiscal measures, incentives
and other support measures, such as the carbon
tax, including an assessment of the measures’
effectiveness and benefits, and any other key
parameters.

- Any other relevant entity about other means of
implementation that may be required.

- Stakeholders, in particular organised business and
labour.

6.5.6 The IGCCC will establish a process to provide
analytical resources to support the development of
the CB approach.

6.6 Sectoral mitigation and lower-carbon de-
velopment strategies

Under the leadership of the relevant national sector
government department, each significantly emitting
economic sector or sub-sector will be required to
formulate mitigation and lower-carbon development
strategies. These strategies will specify a suite of mitigation
programmes and measures appropriate to that sector or
sub-sector. They will also provide measurable and verifiable
indicators for each programme and measure to monitor
their implementation and outcome. These strategies
  

will outline how to implement the proposed mitigation
programmes via existing implementation mechanisms, such
as the IRP 2010, or via modified or new mechanisms (see
10.1.2). For example, in respect of industrial emissions,
approved mitigation plans will conform to the Air Quality
Management Act’s requirements for Pollution Prevention
Plans prepared by identified industries and sectors.

6.7 GHG emissions inventory

Accurate, complete and up-to-date data is the foundation
of an effective response. Two essential elements for the
definition of desired emission reduction outcomes and the
development of CBs are emissions data and data to monitor
the outcome of specific mitigation actions. This section
details the GHG Emissions Inventory and section |2 details
the climate change monitoring and modelling requirements,
as well as the evaluation of mitigation actions.

The DEA in partnership with the South African Weather
Service, the host of the SAAQIS, will prepare a GHG

 

Emissions Inventory annually. The inventory will conform to
the IPCC’s 2006 or later guidelines, and will be periodically
reviewed by an international team of experts. The inventory
will also undertake and report analyses of emissions trends,
including detailed reporting on changes in emissions
intensity in the economy and a comparison of actual GHG
emissions against the benchmark national GHG emission
trajectory range described in section 6.4.

As is currently contemplated by the DEA, reporting
of emissions data will be made mandatory for entities
(companies and installations) that emit more than 0.1 Mt
of GHGs annually, or that consume electricity which results
in more than 0.1 Mt of emissions from the electricity
sector. Qualifying entities will also be obliged to report
energy use by energy carrier and other data as may be
prescribed. The emissions inventory will be a web-based
GHG Emission Reporting System and will form part of the
National Atmospheric Emission Inventory component of
the SAAQIS. It will be developed, tested and commissioned
within two years of the publication of this policy.

7. MANAGING RESPONSE MEASURES

As mentioned in section 4, in addition to the direct physical
impacts of climate change, there are also secondary
economic impacts. As a significant global emitter with a
heavy reliance on coal-based energy, South Africa may
be economically vulnerable to measures taken both
internationally and nationally, to reduce GHG emissions.
The sectors that are particularly vulnerable are those
that are emissions-intensive, and trade-exposed, and may
include iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals and
petrochemicals, mining and quarrying, machinery and
manufacturing,some agricultural exports, as well as transport
services and tourism. Potential economic risks emerge from
the impacts of climate change regulation, the application of
trade barriers, a shift in consumer preferences, and a shift
in investor priorities. There are, however, also economic
opportunities that arise from new or expanded markets,
enhanced efficiencies and improved competitiveness,
development of lower-carbon infrastructure with strong
socio-economic benefits, and the development of a national
environmental goods and services sector.

Government will take a multi-pronged approach to
addressing and managing response measures, especially
in respect of response measures that may have negative
economic impacts. At the international level, South Africa
will engage vigorously in the multilateral climate change
negotiations, to ensure a fair and effective outcome that
is in accordance with the principles of equity, common but
differentiated responsibility, and respective capabilities, and
that provides developing countries with sufficient time and
development space for the required economic transition to
lower-carbon economies.At the national level, the challenge
will be to effectively manage and reduce the economic risks,
and build on and optimise the potential opportunities, and
to ensure a smooth and just transition to a climate-resilient,
equitable and internationally competitive lower-carbon

economy and society.

 
  

 

8. NEAR-TERM PRIORITY FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES

A set of Near-term Priority Flagship Programmes will be
implemented as an integral part of this policy informed by
several important factors including the urgency of acting on
mitigation and adaptation responses as soon as possible as
well as the fact that many sectors have already researched
and have experience in implementing policies and measures
to address the challenges of climate change. The initial
desired emission reduction outcomes, the carbon budgets
and the initial adaptation intervention prioritisation process
will be completed within two years of the publication of this
policy. These programmes will include both the scaling-up
of existing climate change initiatives and new initiatives that
are ready to come on-stream.

The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMCCC) (section 10.2.2)
and the IGCCC sub-committee (section 10.2.3) will take
responsibility for the development and oversight of the
Near-term Priority Flagship Programmes. The appropriate
line function Ministry will elaborate on each Near-term
Priority Flagship Programme and the responsible Minister
will establish teams to create a framework for each
programme. Frameworks will consist of the following:

* A programme for implementation.

* A detailed analysis of mitigation or adaptation
outcomes expected to result from the programme.

*  Aproposal for realising local sustainable development
benefits, including employment, poverty alleviation,
industrial development, reduction in local air pollution
and others.

*  Awell-defined reporting format, which will include a
set of relevant indicators, and a proposal to establish
an annual reporting process.

Based on current analysis, government has identified
an initial list of Near-term Priority Flagship Programmes,
covering both adaptation and _ mitigation
The mitigation programmes cover the major emitting
sectors, have relatively well-known mitigation outcomes
and implementation processes, and are either very cost-

measures.

effective and have significant co-benefits or have technology
development benefits. The Flagship Programmes also utilise,
test and/or demonstrate a suite of policy interventions
including regulatory measures, market-based instruments, tax
incentives and fiscal subsidies, and information and awareness
initiatives. Regulatory measures include renewable energy
and energy efficiency targets complemented by appropriate
standards; market-based instruments including the electricity

generation levy and taxes on motor vehicle emissions and
incandescent light bulbs; tax incentives and fiscal subsidies are
targeted at various programmes that support climate change
mitigation and adaptation objectives; and information and
awareness initiatives including the motor vehicle emissions
labelling scheme.

The following Near-term Priority Flagship Programmes will
be implemented with immediate effect:

8.1 The Climate Change Response Public Works
Flagship Programme

The Climate Change Response Public Works Flagship
Programme includes the consolidation and expansion of
the Expanded Public Works Programme and its sector
components such as the Non-State Sector’s Community
Works Programme and the suite of Environment and
Culture Sector programmes including Working for Water,
Working on Fire, and Working for Energy as these have
proven effective in building climate resilience and relieving
poverty. An example of the biodiversity impacts derived
from Expanded Public Works Programme investment is the
large-scale planting of the Spekboom on degraded public
and private land, thereby re-establishing portions of the
Thicket Biome in the Eastern Cape.

8.2 The Water Conservation and Demand
Management Flagship Programme

The Water Conservation and Demand Management Flagship
Programme includes the accelerated implementation of
the National Water Conservation and Water Demand
Management Strategy in the industry, mining, power
generation, agriculture and water services sectors.
The accelerated provision of rainwater harvesting tanks in
rural and low-income settlements will also form part of this

programme.

8.3 The Renewable Energy Flagship Programme

The Renewable Energy Flagship Programme is inclusive of
a scaled-up renewable energy programme, based on the
current programme specified in the IRP 2010 and using, for
example, the evolving South African Renewables Initiative
led by the Department of Public Enterprise and Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI), as a driver for the deployment
of renewable energy technologies. The programme will be
informed by enhanced domestic manufacturing potential

3|
  

a 32

and the implementation of energy efficiency and renewable
energy plans by local government.

Furthermore, the Department of Energy’s (DoE) solar
water heating programme will be expanded through,
amongst others, the promotion of the domestic supply of
products for solar heating with support from the DTI to
build local manufacturing capacity.

8.4 The Energy Efficiency and Energy Demand
Management Flagship Programme

As part of the Energy Efficiency and Energy Demand
Management Flagship Programme, the DoE will continue
to develop and facilitate an aggressive energy efficiency
programme in industry, building on the experience of
Eskom’s Demand Side Management programme and the
DTI’s National Cleaner Production Centre, and covering
non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured
programme will be established with appropriate initiatives,
incentives and regulation, and a well-resourced information
collection and dissemination process.

A residential energy efficiency programme will also be
included, consisting of two parts:

* The development of appropriate initiatives, incentives
and regulations will be finalised by the DoE and the DTI.
Furthermore, the development of energy specifications
for low-income housing will be determined through
the National Sustainable Settlements Facility under the
Department of Human Settlements.

$ Regulation of commercial and residential building
standards to enforce green building construction
practices. The National Regulator for Compulsory
Specifications in conjunction with the National
Home Builders Registration Council will ensure
that building construction and operation conform
to green building requirements, including measures
such as controlled ventilation, using recycled material,
solar power, etc.

A government building energy efficiency programme led by
the Department of Public Works that initiates energy and
emissions audits of all government buildings and facilities
will be developed. It will develop comparable indicators
and benchmarks, and make appropriate interventions.
The programme will include lead programmes for key
government buildings, including Parliament and the main

government buildings in Pretoria.Ambitious goals for energy
efficiency will be set for all new government buildings.

8.5 The Transport Flagship Programme

As part of the Transport Flagship Programme, the Department
of Transport will facilitate the development of an enhanced
public transport programme to promote lower-carbon
mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an
Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result
in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the
South African vehicle fleet by 2020.

Furthermore, the planned rail re-capitalisation programme
is considered an important component of this Flagship
Programme in so far as it will facilitate both passenger
modal shifts and the shift of freight from road to rail.

Initially led by the Department of Transport, the programme

will also include a Government Vehicle Efficiency
Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of
the government vehicle fleet by 2020. It will encourage new
efficient-vehicle technologies, such as electric vehicles, by

setting procurement objectives for acquiring such vehicles.

8.6 The Waste Management Flagship Programme

Led by the DEA, the Waste Management Flagship
Programme will establish the GHG mitigation potential of
the waste management sector including, but not limited
to, investigating waste-to-energy opportunities available
within the solid-, semi-solid- and liquid-waste management
sectors, especially the generation, capture, conversion and/
or use of methane emissions. This information will be used
to develop and implement a detailed Waste-Related GHG
Emission Mitigation Action Plan aimed at measurable GHG
reductions aligned with any sectoral carbon budgets that may
be set. This Action Plan will also detail the development and
implementation of any policy, legislation and/or regulations
required to facilitate the implementation of the plan.

8.7 The Carbon Capture and Sequestration
Flagship Programme

Led by the DoE in partnership with the South African

Energy Research Institute, the programme includes, among

other initiatives, the development of a Carbon Capture and

Sequestration Demonstration Plant to store the process

emissions from an existing high carbon emissions facility.
  

8.8 The Adaptation Research Flagship Programme

Led by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,
the design and roll-out of a national and regional research
programme to scope sectoral adaptation requirements and
costs and identify adaptation strategies with cross-sectoral
linkages and benefits, including an assessment of climate
change vulnerabilities in the sub-region, with a detailed
scenario planning process to define potential sub-regional

response strategies.

9. JOB CREATION

Unemployment is a key issue for South Africa and is a
critical vulnerability that could be severely worsened by
climate change. Severe income distortions further limit
many people’s ability to build resilience to climate change
impacts. Climate change and responses thereto, will affect
employment, job creation and living standards and, in many
instances, this affect may be negative. Vulnerable low-income
households and the marginalised unemployed will face the
most severe impacts unless urgent steps are taken to reduce
South Africa’s vulnerability to climate and economic shocks.

At the same time climate change responses that improve
resilience could positively impact employment in South
Africa. For example, adaptation could create new jobs
to which workers can migrate from sectors affected by
mitigation strategies. The climate change response will
attempt to reduce the impact of job losses and promote job
creation during the shift towards the new green economy.

The NGP is a clear policy signal of the intention to develop
South Africa’s economy in a manner that harnesses our
natural resources whilst developing and expanding less
carbon-intensive sectors towards a ,,greener’ economy.

9.1 Policy outcomes

In terms of job creation, the short- to medium-term
objective of the National Climate Change Response Policy
is to limit employment contraction to those areas of the
economy where excessive carbon intensity is considered
unsustainable, whilst promoting and expanding the green
economy sectors. Growth in new sectors alone will be
no guarantee of net job creation and government will
promote conditions that will increase the mobility of labour
and capital out of carbon intensive sectors to greener
productive sectors.

The medium- to long-term objective of the National
Climate Change Response Policy will be to promote
investment in human and productive resources and so
enable sustainable growth in green sectors. Investors
will be incentivised to reallocate capital to lower-carbon
investments. Practical interventions will be informed by
accurate assessments of the capacity of various sectors
to adapt to a lower-carbon environment. Net job creation
will be a key performance indicator, as well as baseline
vulnerability measures and sectoral actions to improve
resilience against job losses. This will enable the monitoring
of and reporting on progress made.

9.2 Policy Instruments

The National Employment Vulnerability Assessment (NEVA)
and Sector Jobs Resilience Plans (SJRP) will be used to move
employment from a carbon intensive economy to a lower-
carbon economy.

9.2.1 National Employment Vulnerability

Assessment (NEVA)

The Ministry for Economic Development will publish the
NEVA and so establish a National Employment Vulnerability
Baseline (NEVB). The purpose of the NEVB will be to
inform the prioritisation of mitigation and adaptation
interventions and establish timeframes for addressing
potentially vulnerable sectors.

The NEVA will assess the impact on jobs of climate change
and climate change responses by sector and location
to understand what job-related interventions may be
required and where they may be required. The vulnerability
assessments should also incorporate relevant aspects of
similar assessments that may have been made in other
sectors such as biodiversity, human settlements and disaster
management. The NEVA will be reviewed on a regular basis
that gives sufficient time for interventions to be effective
but is sufficiently often to make proactive changes as and
when necessary.

9.2.2 Sector Jobs Resilience Plans (SJRPs)

Informed by sectoral work carried out by, for example

the Departments of Mineral Resources, Economic
Development and Trade and Industry, SJRPs will explore
the synergy between mitigation and adaptation strategies
and the potential for sustainable net job creation in each
sector. The goal will be to understand the risk relationship
between technology and investment and so_ focus
investments on sectors where government involvement and
skills development will reduce initial barriers to creating
jobs. As technologies show commercial viability with time
and their risk profiles improve, projects may be auctioned
off to investors as a test of the risk appetite of the market.
The purpose will be to implement mechanisms that reduce
risk, showcase alternative lower-carbon interventions, build
capacity and develop skills. Such interventions will focus
on public sector programmes to incentivise employment
creation for those most vulnerable to climate change and
will be a precursor to creating sustainable investments and

jobs. These programmes include:
  

Expanding existing poverty alleviation job creation
programmes, such as the Expanded Public Works
Programme and the National Youth Service.

Promoting job creation incentives in new, green
industries, especially targeting the youth.

Tapping Sector Education and Training Authorities
(SETAs) to aggressively develop and fund mentorship
(including learnerships and internships) programmes.

9.3 Timing of Interventions

The following high-level timeline for the Climate Change
Response Policy with regard to net job creation provides

an overview of the strategic activities required:

9.3.1 Short-Term

Establish links with business and industry, research
bodies, institutions, NGOs and local communities
that can provide relevant data and methodologies for
the establishment of the NEVB.

 

Develop a cooperative governance framework for
establishing the capability to assess employment
vulnerability, including how to determine the cost of
reducing vulnerability.

Conduct the NEVA to inform interventions required
to enable a pro-jobs approach in the climate change
response measures contained in the various sector
plans.

9.3.2 Short- to Medium-Term

Design a SJRP framework for a pro-jobs approach to
implementing climate change response strategies.

Develop SJRPs in consultation with stakeholders
from all NEDLAC constituencies.

Establish links with responsible Ministries to integrate
the outcomes of the NEVA and SJRPs into their
sector plans.

Establish a system to monitor jobs resilience.

10. MAINSTREAMING CLIMATE-RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT

10.1 Policy and planning review and
regulatory audits

Coordination and alignment of policies and actions is
central to achieving climate resilience and in this respect, a
comprehensive review of all government legislation, policy,
strategies, plans and regulatory frameworks will underpin
the successful implementation of the National Climate
Change Response Policy.

The review will be undertaken in terms of Outcome 10,
which forms the basis of the Minister for Environmental
Affairs’ delivery agreement with the President, and the
purpose of the review will be to provide an implementation
protocol for Output 2:

“Output 2: reduce greenhouse gas emission, climate change
impacts and improved airlatmospheric quality”

Achieving climate change resilient development requires
both horizontal and vertical integration of climate change
into government planning, and needs to involve all sectors
of society. Adaptation to climate change and mitigation
of GHG emissions offer opportunities to foster a new
kind of economic development that is sustainable and
that will improve the distribution of resultant economic
gains. The NGP, released by the Department of Economic
Development, provides a significant opportunity in this
regard. However this new direction requires that climate
policy becomes an integral part of the country’s development
strategy and that economic policy tools are developed to
assess the costs and benefits of proposed policy measures
and to periodically evaluate policy effectiveness in terms of
its economic, social and environmental impacts.

To achieve this, South Africa will:

10.1.1 Undertake an audit of existing policy and legislation
to ensure alignment with the objectives of the
National Climate Change Response Policy and
promote the integration of climate change resilience
into all sectoral planning instruments.

10.1.2 Ensure that the prioritised adaptation interventions
(5.1), the benchmark national GHG emission
trajectory range (6.4), sector and sub-sector desired
emission reduction outcomes and CBs (6.5) and
sectoral mitigation and lower-carbon development
strategies are fully integrated into all relevant sector
plans as and when these plans are reviewed, revised
and/or updated;

10.1.3 Undertake a review of the National Climate Change
Response Policy together with a review of progress
in the implementation of the policy every five years.
Coordinated by IGCCC, this review will describe
progress, gaps and proposed adjustments in terms of,
but not limited to, priorities and desired outcomes
over the short-, medium- and long-term, roles and
responsibilities, and arrangements.
The planning horizon for a revised National Climate
Change Response Policy should be, at least, 40 years
and should include:

institutional

- Sectoral adaptation strategies based on sectoral
plans and risk analyses.

- Sector and sub-sector desired emission reduction
outcomes and CBs to be reviewed on a two-year
cycle.

- The identification of economic sectors that may
provide increasing job opportunities and, where
practical, sector-based strategies for migrating jobs
from carbon-intensive sectors of the economy to
lower-carbon sectors to offset possible climate
change and climate change response-related job
losses. See section 9 for details.

- A description of the resource requirements and
how to mobilise them (section I1.1 contains
details of options), and the deployment of market-
based instruments (section 10.7 describes some
market-based instruments options).

10.2 Roles and institutional arrangements

The consistent implementation of the National Climate
Change Response Policy requires a long-term framework
for institutional coordination to:

* Coordinate research and development and promote
innovation.

° Coordinate adaptation and mitigation actions.
* Measure, report and verify climate change responses.

* Facilitate and promote the use of carbon trading and
off-set schemes.

This section describes the roles and _ institutional
arrangements within the public sector, and section 8.3
describes the roles of private sector partners and institutional

arrangements for coordination with stakeholders.
  

All three spheres of government play important roles in
addressing climate change.

National government takes the lead in: formulating the
climate response policy; amending and promulgating
legislation to deal with climate change; establishing and
administering the regulatory framework for managing
emission considering and implementing
market-based instruments such as carbon taxes in the

reductions;

short-term whilst investigating the appropriateness of
emissions trading schemes as a longer-term intervention;
allocating resources and incentives through the Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework; and participating in
international negotiations on climate change. Line function
National Departments will integrate climate change into
their policies and programmes, and will manage Near-term
Priority Flagship Programmes to build climate resilience.

10.2.1 Parliament

Parliament will oversee the development and
implementation of the National Climate Change Response
Policy through the Portfolio Committees, and in particular
the Committees on Water and Environmental Affairs;
Energy; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Trade and

Industry; Mining; Science and Technology; and Transport.

The Portfolio Committees will review legislation to
determine the legal requirements to support the
institutional and regulatory arrangements proposed in this
White Paper, and to ensure policy and legislative alignment.
The Committees will work with the DEA and the IMCCC
to draft any Bills, or an amendment to NEMA, that may be
required within three years of the publication of this policy.

The Portfolio Committees may undertake public hearings
on the National Climate Change Response Policy, and any
of its components.

10.2.2 The Inter-Ministerial Committee on
Climate Change (IMCCC)

The strategic, multi-faceted and cross-cutting nature of
climate-resilient development requires a coordination
committee at executive (Cabinet) level that will coordinate
and align climate change response actions with national
policies and legislation.To this end, the IMCCC shall oversee
all aspects of the implementation of this White Paper.

In particular, the Minister of the Environment will chair
the IMCCC, which will oversee the implementation of the

 

National Climate Change Response Policy, including the
sectoral desired emission reduction outcomes and carbon
budgets development process and adaptation intervention
prioritisation process. The IMCCC will mandate an
interdepartmental task team,a sub-committee of the |GCCC,
to manage the review of the National Climate Change
Response Policy. Technical, analytical and administrative
capacity to the IMCCC and interdepartmental task team
will be provided by a secretariat based in the DEA.The DEA
may co-opt any required skills from other Government
departments (including provincial and local government),
agencies or from outside government.

The secretariat will publish input assumptions, data
and intermediate technical analyses undertaken during
the National Climate Change Response Policy review
processes on a dedicated website. The DEA will hold public
consultations at key points in the National Climate Change
Response Policy review process, including consultations
on methodology and assumptions for any key technical
analyses.

10.2.3 Forum of South African Directors-
General clusters

The national climate change response actions shall be
guided by strategic leadership of the relevant Forum of
South African Directors-General clusters based on their
different mandates: the Economic Sectors and Employment
Cluster on issues that have a strong bearing of economic
growth and employment creation; the Infrastructure cluster
on all infrastructure-related aspects of this policy; and
the International Cooperation Cluster on international
engagements.

10.2.4 Intergovernmental Committee on
Climate Change (IGCCC)

Chapter 3 of the Constitution enjoins government agencies
to operate in accordance with the principles of cooperative
government and intergovernmental relations. These include
the exchange of information, consultation, agreement,
assistance and support as key features of cooperative
government.

The IGCCC has been established to operationalise
cooperative governance in the area of climate change.
Accordingly the IGCCC brings together the relevant
national and provincial departments and organised local
government. The IGCCC therefore has a key role to play in

37
  

ME 38

the review of the National Climate Change Response Policy
as well as its implementation.

10.2.5 National Disaster Management Council

The National Disaster Management Council will be
responsible for ensuring that the National Framework for
Disaster Risk Management provides clear guidance across
all spheres and sectors of government for managing climate
change-related risk and for ensuring that an effective
communications strategy is in place for early warnings to
vulnerable communities with respect to extreme weather
events such as flooding and droughts.

10.2.6 Provincial and local government

The environment is a concurrent function between provincial
and national government, and provinces will coordinate
provincial adaptation and mitigation responses across their
own line departments, as well as between municipalities
within the province. Each province will develop a climate
response strategy, which evaluates provincial climate risks
and impacts and seeks to give effect to the National Climate
Change Response Policy at provincial level.

Local government plays a crucial role in building climate
resilience through planning human settlements and urban
development; the provision of municipal infrastructure
and services; water and energy demand management; and
local disaster response, amongst others. Climate change
considerations and constraints will be integrated into
municipal development planning tools such as Integrated
Development Plans, and municipal service delivery
programmes.

At the same time the mandate for local government
to take on various specific climate change-related
issues is not always clear, and it may be useful to assign
specific powers for mitigation and adaptation actions
such as coastal management, infrastructure management
and natural resource stewardship, some of which fall
within the jurisdictions of other spheres of government.
A critical review of the policy and legislation relating to
local government functions and powers with respect to
climate change is required. The Department of Cooperative
Governance and Traditional Affairs will lead such a process.

The fiscal mechanisms to support local government capital
and operating expenditures currently do not incentivise
municipalities to mainstream effective climate change

responses into local government activities. National
Treasury will lead a process to re-examine the current fiscal
measures and the appropriate incentives for adaptation and

mitigation measures by local government.

Programmes to build capacity for local and provincial
governments’ climate response strategies will be prioritised,
and a climate change toolkit will be prepared for provincial
and local government practitioners.

There is a critical need for best-practice knowledge-sharing
across provinces and municipalities to take advantage of
innovative models in climate change adaptation and mitigation.
This will be coordinated by the DEA and Department of
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs.

In terms of inter-governmental coordination, the Ministerial
political forum (MINMEC) and Outcome 10 Delivery Forum
(MINTECH) set up through the Intergovernmental Relations
Act facilitate a high level of policy and strategy coherence
among the three spheres of government, and will be used to
guide climate change work across the three spheres.

The South African Local Government Association, as a
body mandated to support, represent and advise local
government action, will continue to actively participate in
the inter-governmental system, and ensure the integration
of climate adaptation and mitigation actions into local
government plans and programmes, and lobby for the
necessary regulatory measures and resources to support
local government in this regard.

10.3 Partnering with stakeholders

Climate change is an issue for all South Africans and
government realises that the objectives set out in this
White Paper can only be fully realised with the active
participation of all stakeholders. The government is
committed to engagement and, where
appropriate, partnerships with stakeholders from industry,
business, labour and civil society in a manner that enhances
coordination.

substantive

10.3.1 Business and Industry

As both a significant contributor to GHG emissions and
effective climate change response actions, lower-carbon
products and services and “green” jobs, business and
industry have a fundamental role in South Africa’s climate
  

change response.Thus, government will continue to forge and
maintain effective partnerships with business and industry
to ensure that their capacity is harnessed in driving the
transition to a climate-resilient, equitable and internationally
competitive, lower-carbon economy and society.

Government also recognises the importance of private
sector funding in achieving national climate change response
actions and will work with the financial sector to explore
the most appropriate mechanisms to achieve efficient
funding flows.

Business and industry have already contributed to the
development of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory
by voluntarily submitting GHG data to Government.
It is intended to build on these voluntary initiatives
to develop the mandatory reporting system for GHG
emissions (see 6.7).

Government will also continue to encourage voluntary
reporting initiatives established and maintained by a variety
of organised business associations.

10.3.2 Civil Society

The role of citizens and organised groupings within civil
society are important to the success of a national effort.
Civil society needs to critically evaluate, comment on and
respond to the initiatives of government and the private
sector. They must continue to raise public awareness,
and motivate individuals, institutions and authorities to
take actions that reduce GHG emissions and that adapt
to the adverse impacts of climate change. Civil society
organisations that work directly with communities and
particularly with the urban and rural poor and with
women are an important conduit for ensuring that
climate information is timeously communicated and to
inform government and research institutions of vulnerable
groupings’ climate change-related issues.

10.3.3 Academia and scientists

The climate change science and academic community must
work together to improve projections of climate change,
its impacts, key vulnerabilities in affected sectors and
communities. They need to explore appropriate mitigation
and adaptation responses; continue to build capacity in
climate change science; and inform government and the
public of climate change-related socio-economic challenges
and opportunities.

 

10.4 Coordination Mechanisms

The following mechanisms will be used to coordinate
climate change activities and consult on climate change
policies with stakeholders:

10.4.1 National Committee on Climate Change
(NCCC)

The NCCC has been set up to consult with stakeholders
from key sectors that impact on or are impacted by climate
change. The Committee advises on matters relating to
national responsibilities with respect to climate change, and
in particular in relation to the UNFCCC and the Kyoto
protocol. It also advises on the implementation of climate
change-related activities.

Government will consider proposals for increasing the
functions of the NCCC beyond the current communication
function and to formalise its status as an advisory council
with statutory powers and responsibilities.

10.4.2 National Economic Development and
Labour Council (NEDLAC)

NEDLAC serves as the forum where government comes
together with organised business, labour and community
groupings on a national level, and this platform will ensure
that climate change policy implementation is balanced and
meets the needs of all sectors of the economy. NEDLAC has
indicated that climate change should be a key component
of its agenda.

10.5 Communication and behaviour change

Developing climate resilience requires all of us to change
our behaviour and become conscious of our individual
carbon footprints.A nuanced approached to communication
will be followed, recognising that a communication strategy
aimed at individuals and communities with the largest
carbon footprints (the urban wealthy) needs to be very
different from a communication strategy aimed at the
individuals and communities most vulnerable to climate
change impacts (the rural poor). It is also recognised that
people will only make climate-friendly decisions if they have
convenient, reliable and safe climate-friendly alternatives
and if they know about these options.

One of the important communication challenges is to
disseminate information to interested and affected people

39
  

a 40

as quickly as possible and to ensure that the information is in
a format that is accessible and useful to the target audience.
This is especially important for early warning systems where
people need to take specific actions to reduce risks to
themselves, their households and property.

To meet these challenges, South Africa will:

10.5.1 Empower all residents with information about the
potential impacts of climate change and climate
change resilience actions, emphasising the information
needs of those most vulnerable to climate change.

10.5.2 Ensure that all relevant climate change information
systems implement
strategies to ensure that information
the target audiences efficiently and effectively.
This includes exploring and developing new and novel
ways of communicating, especially to people who
are illiterate and/or have no access to telephonic or
other forms of electronic communication.

effective |§ communication

reaches

10.5.3 Ensure that all government climate change response
strategies and actions plans include sections on
education, awareness, outreach and human resource
development.

10.5.4 Design, develop and roll-out a climate change
awareness campaign that make all South Africans
more aware of the challenge of climate change and
the need for appropriate responses and choices at
individual and community level.

10.6 Regulatory measures

Sectoral legislation already provides an extensive regulatory
framework for the actions of Government departments,
agencies, business and civil society. To ensure that climate
change considerations and the climate change responses
outlined in this White Paper are fully mainstreamed into the
work of all three spheres of government, all Government
departments and all state-owned enterprises will review
the policies, strategies, regulations and plans falling within
their jurisdiction on a regular basis to ensure full alignment
with the National Climate Change Response Policy.

Local government plays a particularly important role in
implementing adaptation and mitigation actions, some
of which extend beyond the existing Constitutional and
legislative mandate of local government. In the review

process mentioned above, particular attention will be paid
to local government legislation, and the Department of
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs will lead a
review of local government legislation in this regard.

South Africa will use Section 29(1) of the Air Quality Act
to manage GHG emissions from all significant industrial
sources (those responsible for more than 0.1% of total
emissions for the sector) in line with approved mitigation
plans that conform to the Act’s requirements for pollution
prevention plans prepared by identified industries and
sectors. The synergy between prevention measures to
reduce conventional air pollutants and GHG mitigation will
be used in a holistic approach to manage air quality.

10.7 Market-based instruments

In 2006, Government published a draft Environmental Fiscal
Reform Policy Paper entitled A Framework for Considering
Market-Based Instruments to Support Environmental Fiscal
Reform in South Africa. This policy paper recognised the role
for environmentally-related taxes to complement existing
regulatory policy interventions and address environmental
problems such as climate change. Government has since
introduced the following climate change-related measures:
the electricity generation levy; motor vehicle emissions
tax; the levy on incandescent light bulbs complemented by
a range of tax incentive measures to support renewable
energy investments (depreciation allowances for renewable
electricity generation and biofuels production); investments
in projects under the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) (that is, income tax exemption for revenues from the
sale of certified emission reduction units resulting from CDM
projects); biodiversity conservation and management; and the
proposed energy efficiency savings tax allowances.As part of
the process of exploring more comprehensive reforms for
addressing climate change, the National Treasury published
the carbon tax discussion paper entitled Reducing Greenhouse
Gas Emissions: The Carbon Tax Option for public comments
in December 2010. The paper elaborated on the role for
carbon taxes as a policy measure to stimulate behaviour
changes among producers and consumers in favour of less
energy intensive, lower-carbon emitting alternatives.

10.7.1 Carbon Pricing

In economic terms, environmental resources can be largely
classified as a “public good” which are accessible by all and
can be consumed in infinite quantities. Climate change and
  

its effects are the result of GHG emissions that impose
external costs or an “externality” on society. In most cases,
these negative external damage costs of an economic
activity are not reflected in the prices of goods and services,
often resulting in their under-pricing and an over- or mis-
allocation of resources.

Accordingly, the prices of environmental goods and services
that generate excessive levels of GHG emissions should
be adjusted to reflect the full costs of production and
consumption. Carbon taxes can help to internalise these
negative externalities and create the correct incentives
to stimulate behavioural changes among producers and
consumer in favour of cleaner, lower-carbon technologies,
promoting the uptake of energy efficiency measures and
research, development and technology innovation.

In this context, the NationalTreasury will continue to develop
carbon tax policy and the following key considerations will
inform this process:

. The tax rate should, over time, be equivalent to the
marginal external damage costs of GHGs to affect
appropriate incentives. However, in the absence
of an international climate change agreement and
therefore a global emissions pricing system, a partial,
rather than full, internalisation of the externality will
be considered as an interim measure.

* Technical and administrative feasibility — consideration
will be given to whether the tax applies to carbon
emissions or a proxy for such emissions (e.g. fuel
inputs or outputs). Should a proxy tax base be used,
the levy of the tax according to the carbon content
of fossil fuels will be considered.

. Distributional implications — measures will be taken,
either in tax design or through complementary
expenditure programmes, to offset the burden such a
tax will place on poor households.

* Competitiveness — to address potential negative
impacts on industry competitiveness, the introduction
of carbon taxes at initial low rates with a commitment
to phased-in increasing levels of taxation over a
specific period will be considered; which would grant
taxpayers an opportunity to adjust to the new tax.

* A phased implementation of the tax towards
comprehensive coverage of all economic sectors is
believed to be desirable and will be considered.

 

* The minimisation of the potential

regressive

impacts on the poor and the protection of the
competitiveness of key industries will be considered.
Furthermore, revenue recycling to minimise the
costs of the tax through, for example, some form
of tax shifting will be considered. However, although
the full earmarking of revenues is not regarded as
being in line with sound fiscal policy principles, some
form of on-budget funding for specific environmental
programmes will be considered.

. Relief measures, if any, will be considered by these will
be regarded as being minimal and temporary.

Although a carbon tax does not set a fixed quantitative
limit on GHG emissions over the short-term, such a tax -
at an appropriate level and phased-in over a period to the
“correct” level - will provide a strong price signal to both
producers and consumers to change their behaviour over
the medium- to long-term. The National Treasury’s carbon
tax policy will seek to primarily stimulate behaviour change
through the price mechanism, and as a secondary benefit,
generate a revenue stream that may allow fiscal decisions
over time that support climate change policy and broader
sustainable development objectives.

10.7.2 Carbon Markets

Carbon markets are mechanisms for exchanging emission
reductions between entities, thereby optimising efficiency
and minimising cost in controlling pollution levels.
They include both cap-and-trade mechanisms (in which
mandatory limitations on emissions create markets in which
polluters trade emissions allowances) and offset schemes

where actors voluntarily pay compensation for emissions.

In respect of carbon markets, the National Treasury will
investigate the feasibility of an emissions trading scheme as
a medium- to long-term response to climate change.

10.7.3 Incentives

Incentives, including regulatory, economic and _ fiscal
measures, encourage and reward efforts to curb GHG
emissions. They can apply to a broad range of sectors. Some
existing incentives include lower fuel taxes on cleaner fuels
and energy efficiency incentives. Further incentive measures
will be explored as part of a suite of policy instruments to
promote climate resilience, including job creation incentives
in new, green industries, especially for the youth.

4|
  

ma 42

Government recognises the important role for market-based
instruments that create fiscal incentives and disincentives to
support climate change policy objectives. Thus, South Africa
will employ market-based instruments as part of a suite of
policy interventions to support the transition to a lower-
carbon economy. These instruments will be designed to
incentivise behaviour change at the individual, institutional
and macro-economic levels for a climate-resilient South
Africa contributing to a diversification of our energy mix,
drive people to implement far-reaching energy efficiency
measures, achieve passenger modal shifts, and generate
investments in new and cleaner technologies and industries.

 
  

| |. RESOURCE MOBILISATION

Responding to climate change is expensive and will require a
comprehensive resource package. South Africa is therefore
committed to mobilising the resources that are necessary
for both mitigation and adaptation. This includes financial
resources, technical cooperation and technology transfers
at domestic, sub-regional, regional, and international levels.

Estimates for the cost of responding to climate change
indicate that between 1% to 2.5% of global GDP will need
to be spent on mitigation and 1.5% to 3% of GDP in Africa
will need to be spent on adaptation by 2030. Impacts (and
benefits) will be unevenly distributed across countries and
between sectors. The cost of adaptation is likely to increase
in future years.

South Africa’s resource mobilisation strategy will be
informed by the mainstreaming of climate change into the
planning and decision-making of government, private sector
and civil society. Government aims to:

$ Create an enabling environment whereby government,
private sector and civil society collectively respond
to the economic and social changes necessary for
climate-resilient development and job creation,
providing for the economic and social upliftment of
the people of South Africa, while minimising negative
impacts on future development.

° Promote the green economy as an effective
investment in climate change response and secure
resources to support climate change and green

economy interventions.

° Consolidate and extend existing initiatives towards
a climate-resilient economy. Thus, the Near-term
Priority Flagship Programmes mentioned in section
8 will form the foundation for the next phase in the
transition to a lower-carbon and climate-resilient
economy and society. However, Government will
endeavour to continuously evaluate its priorities to
adjust to the dynamic nature of the socio-economic
transformation envisaged.

I 1.1 Finance

As a developing country, South Africa recognises that
international resources (as envisaged under the UNFCCC)
need to complement domestic resources to finance the

 

cost of transition to a climate-resilient society. Hence,
Government will actively pursue the mobilisation and
effective use of these international resources.

Further, Government recognises that improved finance
policy coordination is critical to creating a sustainable
climate finance architecture for South Africa. New market-
based instruments as well as environment-related financial
reforms in the private and public sectors will seek to
fundamentally transform South Africa into a climate-
resilient economy and society.

11.1.1 The role of financial institutions

South Africa recognises that financial institutions are
important intermediaries to allocate and transfer capital
between different economic activities. Government
acknowledges and supports initiatives by the South African
banks to integrate environmental considerations into their
decision-making frameworks. The different distribution
channels in the financial system, such as public finance, banks
(including development finance and microfinance institutions),
investors and insurers, are important development partners

for Government in the following ways:

* Public finance can support climate change through
the procurement of sustainable technologies by
Government as well as developing catalytic projects
and programmes.

* The development finance system in South Africa
is critical to integrating development with climate
change. Development finance institutions, such as
the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA),
Industrial Development Corporation, Land Bank
and Khula Enterprises can incubate climate-resilient
development. This is particularly true for climate-
proofing of infrastructure and industrial processes;
designing and testing new financing instruments;
localising and rolling out of sustainable technologies;
and unlocking new economic opportunities through
enterprise development and job creation. Further,
these institutions serve an important role in building
technical capacity and knowledge platforms to
mobilise action at regional, provincial and local level.

. Private banks and microfinance institutions support a
range of corporate and entrepreneurial ventures that
could contribute to climate change resilience.

o
  

a 44

é Investors such as asset managers, venture capital and
private equity firms are essential for both long-term
and early-stage investments.

é Insurers are essential for risk mitigation and
innovative climate change-related products.

* International and corporate grant-providers are
necessary to support the comprehensive financing
package necessary for the scale of mitigation and
adaptation interventions that South Africa needs.

Different types of financial institutions should work together
in a coordinated manner to blend different forms of capital.

11.1.2 Mobilising finance

The emerging climate change response finance options
include grants for research and development; project
development and technical cooperation; and commercial
finance through debt and equity, concessionary finance,
risk insurance, specialised environmental funds and new
capital market innovations, such as green and climate bonds.
These options may be extended by integrating financing
for biodiversity and other environmental resources, such
as payment for ecosystem goods and services, for example.
By necessity, South Africa’s climate finance strategy will
comprise a comprehensive suite of measures to create and
maintain a long-term funding framework for mitigation and
adaptation actions and to trigger swift and urgent action
towards climate-resilient development.

Government will:

1 1.1.2.a Continue to proactively contribute to the technical
and institutional reform debates of the UNFCCC
financing measures to ensure that developing and
least-developed countries such as those in the
Southern African Development Community region
can access the additional and necessary resources
in a fair, transparent and timely manner.

I1.1.2.b Make every effort to attract and secure additional
international resources through official development
assistance and bilateral development agencies.
Government will ensure that such climate change-
related contributions are directed to national,
provincial and local government development
priorities.

I1.1.2.c Create a transitional climate finance system

to support the implementation of the priority
mitigation and adaptation actions identified in
sections 5 and 6. See section | |.1.3 for details.

I1.1.2.d Create a transitional tracking facility for climate
finance mechanisms and climate responses that will
monitor and coordinate existing climate finance
flows.

I1.1.2.e Partner with domestic financial institutions to fast-
track and mainstream climate-resilient development
(i.e. mitigation and adaptation).

I1.1.2.f Support donor organisations in their efforts to
apply funding towards climate change-related pilot
programmes and activities.

[1.1.2 Promote the development of, and investment in,
a climate-resilient region and work with regional
partners to create and maintain interdependent
economic and social opportunities that reduce the
region’s dependency on climate vulnerable sectors.

11.1.3 The Immediate Transition

During the immediate transition period between the
publication of this Policy and the evolution of appropriate
climate financing systems and institutions, Government will
establish an interim climate finance coordination mechanism
to secure the necessary resources for mitigation and
adaptation priority programmes identified in sections 5,
6 and 8. The mechanism will match the resources to the
priority programmes, including grants, concessionary debt
and risk insurance products.

The mechanism will also contain a climate finance tracking
facility to track the use and impact of funds. Government
will determine the terms of reference for the mechanism in
consultation with the private sector and civil society.

The National Treasury will identify the initial custodian of
the coordination mechanism.

11.1.4 Financing the National Climate Change
Response Policy

Stable, well governed institutions are critical to funding South
Africa’s transition path to climate-resilient development.
In pursuit of a long-term funding framework for climate
finance, Government will:
  

I1.1.4.a Promote fair, transparent and timely access to
international and domestic resources for both
mitigation and adaptation actions by the public and
private sectors as well as civil society.

11.1.4.b Mainstream climate change response into the fiscal
budgetary process and so integrate the climate
change response programmes at national, provincial
and local government and at development finance
institutions and state-owned entities.

I1.1.4.c Enable the local development finance institutions to
create and implement long-term climate-resilient
investment programmes. This includes project
development, financial and risk insurance products,
technical assistance and capacity-building within
their mandates.

I1.1.4.d Identify opportunities in the existing financial
regulations governing the domestic finance sector
to enhance the financial sector’s capacity to
mainstream climate change in risk and investment
decisions.

[1.1.4.e Establish and/or support public platforms to
assimilate and disseminate climate science, finance,
technology and other related research and
information to enable effective decisions about risk
and investment.

I1.1.4.f Develop a climate finance strategy that
contextualises and integrates existing and emerging
policy and financing instruments, — including

addressing the role of market-based measures to
achieve the desired economic and social changes.

The Ministers of Finance, Economic Development, and Water
and Environmental Affairs will appoint a multi-stakeholder
working group to oversee the realisation of these actions
within three years of the publication of this policy.

11.2 Education

Climate change is a relatively new issue that has cross-
disciplinary and cross-sectoral implications in South Africa.
Understanding the concept as well as the options to mitigate
it and adapt to it is fundamental to future development
pathways and the wellbeing of South African society. This
will require systematic interventions to empower and
capacitate people. We need to mainstream climate change

 

knowledge into education and training curricula. Climate
change education should be part of the broader framework
of education for sustainable development, and should equip
South African citizens to re-orient society towards social,
economic and ecological sustainability.

To meet this challenge, South Africa will:

11.2.1 Ensure that a holistic understanding of climate change
and related issues (specifically the required response
to climate change) is included in all relevant aspects
of formal education curricula. This will prepare future
generations for a rapidly changing planet and the
transition to a lower-carbon society and economy.

11.2.2 Include climate change elements in the review of the
National Skills Development Strategy and ensure
that all SETAs add climate change to priority skills
development programmes in the formal, informal
and non-formal sectors of the education and training
system. This will be accompanied by requisite
resource reallocation.

11.2.3 Establish incentives for research and training such
as bursaries to encourage students and scholars to
research and study climate change.

11.2.4 Ensure that the building of knowledge and expertise
in new and emerging economic sectors is considered
in all tertiary education curricula and relevant formal
and informal training.

11.2.5 Establish a robust research agenda that, amongst
others, focuses on quantitative research on the
labour requirements for the green transition as well
as on other societal adaptation strategies and needs.

11.2.6 Encourage tertiary and research _ institutions
to develop national monitoring, reporting and
verification guidelines for a climate-resilient South
Africa. These guidelines would focus on mitigation
and adaptation actions such as land-use practises

and change.

11.3 Science and technology development

South Africa needs a robust and highly functional climate
change science and technology platform to enable the
development and implementation of appropriate actions
to minimise the negative impacts of climate change on

s—
  

me 46

the economy and the people of South Africa. With such a
platform, South Africa can become a significant global player
in the green economy. More specifically, South Africa should
aim to be a leading supplier of climate change knowledge,
technologies and services.

* The decision at a national level to adopt innovations
depends on the benefits users expect from the
innovations as well as on the expected costs to
research and master them. In addition, a country
needs the technological capability to imitate, adapt
and absorb foreign technologies into local productive
activities. This capability influences the relative costs
and benefits of adopting new technologies.

* For South Africa to enhance its international
competitiveness in climate change response science
and technology, it needs sound science, a robust
technology base and sound human capital in this
arena. To achieve this vision, the following measures
will be implemented:

11.3.1 Highly informed decision-making

Anew governance arrangement will be instituted comprising
a Chief Scientific Advisor to the Minister of Science and
Technology. The Minister of Science and Technology, with
the advice of the Chief Scientific Advisor, will establish and
constitute a Scientific Advisory Council. The Council will
consist of a wide range of expertise to cover the spectrum
of South Africa’s climate change response requirements. The
Chief Scientific Advisor will chair this Council. The Advisory
Council will produce a biennial report to the Cabinet on
the state of climate change science and technology in South
Africa. It will be developed into an institution with a good
international record that can give scientific advice and it will
bring the scientific community closer to decision-makers
and implementers.

11.3.2 Medium- and long-term planning

An analysis of the state of climate change science and
technology reveals that the current scientific output,
technology development, intellectual property and the pool
of high level skills are inadequate to support a robust climate
change response. Because the response to climate change
is so complex, Government and the scientific community
will conduct a climate change foresight exercise. Such an
exercise will deliver the following:

*  Ahuman capital development plan for climate science
and technology informed by the country’s climate
change response requirements and the outcomes of
the National Employment Vulnerability Baseline and
Assessments as well as the Sector Jobs Resilience Plan.

* A complementary science and technology plan for
climate change in partnership with the Department
of Science and Technology (DST).

*  Aclimate change technology roadmap.

To address the funding needed to support climate change
research and development, the DST will conduct a feasibility
study into the development of a specialised funding agency:
the Climate Change Science Council. In parallel to this
study, the DEA will engage the relevant partners in the
DST, National Research Foundation (NRF), the Technology
Innovation Agency and the DTI to develop the following
R&D funding instruments:

° Climate Change Research Chairs in the family of the
DST/NRF South African Research Chairs Initiative.

* A Climate Change component within the current
NRF-administered Technology and Human Resources
and Innovation Programme sponsored by the DTI.

* Climate Change Centres of Excellence to develop
much higher levels of climate change science and
produce more PhDs and Post-Doctoral fellows in
this area and to develop intellectual property and
technologies that will make South Africa a global
leader in climate change science.

* Research and innovation partnerships in the area of
climate change resilience.

11.3.3 Technology transfer

Technology transfer continues to be very prominent in the
multilateral environmental agreements in general, and in
climate change-related agreements in particular. A national
capacity to optimally engage climate change-related
technology for South Africa, both as a recipient as well as
donor to other developing countries, will be developed.
  

 

12. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Measurement and monitoring of climate change responses
is critical to ensure their effective implementation. South
Africa’s efforts in this regard will be coordinated through the
cooperative governance mechanisms reflected in section 10.
The DEA as the responsible coordinating department will
define review mechanisms as well as a process to develop
this White Paper into a suite of regulatory and legislative
instruments where required.

12.1 Monitoring Climate Change

Given the nature and implications of climate change and
the economic and social implications of effective climate
change responses, decisions must be based on accurate,
current and complete information in order to reduce risk
and ensure that interventions are effective. South Africa will:

12.1.1 Ensure that nation-wide climate change and
atmosphere monitoring systems are maintained
and enhanced where necessary, including through
monitoring networks at appropriate spatial density
and frequency that monitor, among others, rainfall,
ambient air temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
wind and solar radiation, lightning, extreme
weather event characteristics and their impacts,
selected atmospheric GHGs, gas fluxes from
selected vegetation, soil and marine carbon pools,
sea levels, sea surface temperature, ocean current
behaviour and acidity. Data analysis, synthesis,
archiving, interpretation and dissemination will be
a key component of this effort.

12.1.2 Ensure that climate change impacts are monitored
at appropriate spatial density and frequency, where
feasible, of changes in spatial distribution and
incidence of climate-sensitive diseases; ecosystems
and the goods and services they supply; key species
responses (including invasive alien species); wildfire
hydrology and water resources; and agricultural

and forestry production.

12.1.3. Establish a monitoring system for gathering
information (with bottom-up inputs
possible) and reporting progress on the

implementation of adaptation actions.

where

12.1.4 — Identify the key role-players involved in monitoring
and measuring these indicators. Describe
how these role-players will share and report

information on observed climate change.

12.1.5 In line with internationally agreed

reporting
requirements, include a summary of climate change

impacts and adaptation actions in the National
Communication, which highlights new areas of
concern and areas in which observations do not
align with modelled projections.

12.2 Medium- and long-term modelling

Adaptation requires proactive interventions that minimise
projected climate change impacts. To achieve this, medium-
and long-term climate projections that represent the full
range of possible climate outcomes must be available.
They include the risk and scale of projected impacts, the
costs and benefits of possible responses, and the risks of their
failure. Because local authorities will plan and implement
many of the climate change responses, predictions need to
be at a level that they can use. To this end, South Africa will:

12.2.1 Within two years of the publication of this policy,
finalise, publish and start implementing the 10-year
Global Change Research Plan for South Africa,
especially those elements of the plan that increases
South Africa’s modelling capacity for climate and

impacts projections and vulnerability assessments.

12.2.2. Within two years of the publication of this policy,
compile and publish a strategy to continuously
update and maintain the SARVA, using the full range
of medium- and long-term climate modelling results

and the full range of possible risks.

12.2.3 Within two years of the publication of this policy,
develop and pilot a methodology to downscale
climate information and comprehensive impact
assessments to specific geographical areas, including
provinces and municipalities. This methodology
will avoid inappropriate treatment of fine-scale
information as indicating greater certainty in
climate outcomes, allow for plans that can respond
to unfolding climate trends, and lower the risk of
mal-adaptation.

12.2.4 Roll out the downscaling work within two years
of the publication of this policy onwards, with

appropriate monitoring and evaluation safeguards.

12.2.5 Ensure that all National Communications submitted
as part of South Africa’s UNFCCC commitments

contain the most up to date medium- and

7
  

a 48

long-term modelling results and appropriately
downscaled risk and impact assessments.

12.3 Monitoring responses

To monitor the success of responses to climate change
and to replicate the ones that have worked well, we need
to measure their cost, outcome and impact. To this end,
South Africa will, within two years of the publication of this
policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response
Monitoring and Evaluation System. The system will evolve
with international measuring, reporting and verification
(MRY) requirements.

12.3.1 An outcomes-based system

Monitoring and evaluation of the Country's climate change
programme shall be undertaken through the outcomes-
based system that the Presidency has established and shall be
reported through the delivery forums for these outcomes.
As part of its overall responsibility to review progress across
government and across the outcomes, the Department of
Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency
will make sure that climate change implementation is
properly integrated across Government. Reporting on
climate responsibilities and adaptation measures will
consequently be integrated into the Programme of Action
and the Ministerial delivery agreements, as well as the
quarterly reporting requirements of government at all
levels. Key outcomes include:

é Outcome 4: Decent employment through inclusive
growth;

* Outcome 5: A skilled and capable workforce to
support an inclusive growth path;

. Outcome 7: Vibrant, fair and sustainable rural
communities and food security for all;

. Outcome 8: Sustainable human settlements and an
improved quality of household life;

. Outcome 9: Responsive, accountable, effective and
efficient local government system;

. Outcome 10: Environmental assets and natural
resources that are well protected and continually

enhanced;

. Outcome ||: Creating A better South Africa and
Contributing to a Better (and Safer) Africa and a
better World;

12.3.2 Mitigation

South Africa’s climate change mitigation interventions will
be monitored and measured against the National Emissions
Trajectory Range (see section 6.4).

Furthermore, the implementation of objectives and
measures specified in the Carbon Budget and sectoral
mitigation strategies will be measured, reported and verified
to assess progress in their implementation. The Climate
Change Response Monitoring and Evaluation System will
assess indicators defined in the Carbon Budget and sectoral
mitigation strategies (see section 6.5), which may include
indicators of implementation, local sustainable development
benefits and the impact of programmes and measures on
emissions. The monitoring process will be implemented
through sectoral implementation mechanisms, and will be
coordinated and overseen by the DEA, which will publish
the outcomes of the monitoring process annually.

An international climate deal is likely to include an
international MRV system that will monitor and report on
mitigation actions in developing countries. South Africa will
use the National Communication reporting requirements
of the UNFCCC for this.
 13. CONCLUSION

Amongst a range of environmental constraints that are of
necessity playing an increasing role in social development
planning, climate change represents the most urgent and
far-reaching challenge of our time.While every country will
have to develop its own adaptive responses to the effects
of climate change, mitigating climate change to ensure the
disruption caused to human and natural systems is within
manageable parameters can only arise out of a global
response. Furthermore, responding to climate change
is a cross-generational challenge. The effects of action or
inaction will not be felt immediately, but will have significant

consequences for future generations.

It is within this context, and informed by an appropriate
sense of urgency, that the South African government has
developed this National Climate Change Response Policy.
The current plan represents the first iteration of South
Africa’s ongoing efforts to adapt to climate change and
contribute to the global mitigation effort. In terms of our
contribution to the global mitigation effort, the decision to
institute sectoral desired emission reduction outcomes and
carbon budgets is momentous — it represents a concrete

and practical commitment by South Africa.

Realising this commitment will require sustained effort
and cooperation from all spheres of government, the
private sector and civil society formations, and ultimately
will depend on decisions by individual citizens to embrace
climate-friendly lifestyles and habits. Everyone
stakeholder in this plan, and the level of engagement from
the public in the process of drafting the National Climate
Change Response suggests that there is no shortage of the
requisite will to make the far-reaching changes that are
required. Government wishes to thank all stakeholders for
their contributions to this process, and more importantly,
for their commitment to building a climate-resilient South

Africa for the current and future generations.
