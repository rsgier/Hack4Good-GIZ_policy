A systems approach to sustainability is one where the
economic system, the socio-political system and the
ecosystem are embedded within each other, and then
integrated through the governance system that holds
all the other systems together in a legitimate regulatory
framework. Sustainability implies the continuous and
mutually Compatible integration of these systems over
time. Sustainable development means making sure
that these systems remain mutually compatible as the
key development challenges are met through specific
actions and interventions to eradicate poverty and severe
inequalities.

In 2008, Cabinet approved the South
Africa National Framework for Sustainable

Development (NFSD). The approval
signalled a new wave of thinking aimed
at promoting the effective stewardship
of South Africa’s natural, social and
economic resources. This National
Strategy for Sustainable Development
and Action Plan — also referred to as
NSSD 1 (2011-2014) — was approved by
Cabinet on 23 November 2011. The NSSD
1 builds on the 2008 NFSD and several
initiatives that were launched by the
business sector, government, NGOs, civil
society, academia and other key role
players to address issues of sustainability
in South Africa. The NSSD 1 will be
implemented during the period 2011-
2014. The lessons and evaluation of
progress regarding the implementation
of NSSD 1 will inform NSSD 2 (2015-2020).

This is a proactive strategy that regards
sustainable development as a_ long-
term commitment, which combines
environmental protection, social equity
and economic efficiency with the vision
and values of the country. The NSSD 1
marks the continuation of a national
partnership for sustainable development.
It is a milestone in an ongoing process
of developing support, and initiating and
upscaling actions to achieve sustainable
development in South Africa. The 1992
Rio Earth Summit, which was followed by
the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit
on Sustainable Development, provided
a platform to learn and begin to

implement sustainability practices. The
2012 Rio+20 identified two important
themes to support the country’s efforts.
These are the green economy, in the
context of sustainable development and
poverty eradication, and the institutional
framework for sustainable development.

The following five strategic objectives are
identified in the NSSD 1:

1. Enhancing systems for integrated
planning and implementation

2. Sustaining our ecosystems and using

natural resources efficiently

Towards a green economy

Building sustainable communities

5. Responding effectively to climate
change

so

Various interrelated and enabling
interventions that promote sustainable
development are being implemented
throughout the country. The NSSD 1
identifies 113 interventions that can be
monitored for implementation. The twenty
headline indicators have been identified
to monitor progress in the implementation
of NSSD 1 (2011-2014). These headline
indicators are selected from existing
indicators including the Development
Indicators, the Millennium Development
Goals and the 12 government outcomes.

The Department of Environmental Affairs
will establish and oversee the National
Committee on Sustainable Development
(NCSD) that will operate in multifolds

among government spheres to engage
civil society, NGOs, the private sector,
academia, independent reviewers
and other multistakeholders. South
Africa's commitment to a_ long-term
sustainable development _ trajectory
that is economically, socially and
environmentally sustainable, requires
scientific, technological and innovation
capabilities, supported by strategic public
investments and_ strategic partnerships.
The department, in collaboration with all
key stakeholders, will galvanise action
towards the implementation of the
strategy through the harmonised planning
of programmes and execution.

The team responsible forthe development,
coordination, monitoring and reporting
of the NSSD 1 comprises Ms Dorah Nteo,
Ms Mapula Tshangela and Ms Faith
Phooko, acknowledging the contribution
of the previous team, Ms Keleabetswe
Tlouane and Mr Eddy Moeketsi. Enquiries

implementation can be directed to:

Sustainable development is increasingly being acknowledged
worldwide as a conceptual framework for development that
recognises the interdependency between economic growth, social
equity and environmental integrity.

In 2008, Cabinet approved the National
Framework for Sustainable Development
(NFSD), which signalled a new wave of
thinking that was aimed at promoting
the effective stewardship of South Africa's
natural, social and economic resources.

The National Strategy for Sustainable
Development and Action Plan — also
known as the NSSD 1 (2009-201 4) — builds
on the NFSD and several initiatives that
have been launched by the business
sector, government, NGOs, civil society,
academia and other key role players to
address issues of sustainability in South
Africa.

The NSSD 1 presents an understanding
of sustainable development and
explains the route that is being taken. It
presents an action plan and indicators
for the implementation of the strategy.
It is not prescriptive, but is enabling
in orientation and will be used to
review sustainability programmes. The
strategy calls for an interdependency
approach across sectors and action
on sustainability. It covers the key areas
of human development (people),
ecological protection (the planet) and
economic growth (prosperity). In order to
be competitive in the future economic
landscape, new ways of doing business will

 

be required, as well as progressive leaders
who are willing and able to incorporate a
long-term vision in their planning.

Furthermore, the strategy invites all
role players to engage in an ongoing
and constructive dialogue. This will be
inspired by the need to develop a more
efficient and equitable economy. It is
critical that all role players implement
the strategy initiatives and that collective
actions make a significant contribution
to environmental sustainability.

 1.1. Sustainability and
sustainable development

Although the concept of sustainable
development has been on_ the
international agenda since the United
Nations Conference on the Human
Environment in Stockholm in 1972, the
terms ‘sustainability’ and ‘sustainable
development’ have been used and

interpreted in widely different ways. In
developing this strategy for sustainable
development, a fixed definition of these
terms has been accepted in a South
African context.

 

Sustainability (or a sustainable socie-
ty) is seen as the overall goal of the
NSSD 1. Sustainability in this context
implies ecological sustainability. |n
the first instance, it recognises that the
maintenance of healthy ecosystems
and natural resources are preconditions
for human wellbeing. In the second
instance, it recognises that there are
limits to the goods and services that can
be provided. In other words, ecological
sustainability acknowledges that human
beings are part of nature and not a
separate entity.

Sustainable development is the process
that is followed to achieve the goal of

sustainability. Sustainable development
implies the selection and implementation
of a development option, which allows
for appropriate and justifiable social and
economic goals to be achieved, based
on the meeting of basic needs and
equity, without compromising the natural
system on which it is based.

1.2 From vision to action:
the NSSD 1 process

The process of developing the NSSD 1 is
undertaken according to the following
phases:

Phase |; 2003-2008: Phase | involved
an analysis of long-term economic,
social and environmental trends and
telated policy initiatives. This informed
the vision, goals and strategic priorities
for sustainable development and
culminated in the NFSD, which was
adopted by Cabinet in June 2008.

Phase Il; 2009-2010: Phase Il involved the
formulation of a strategy and action plan
for the period 2010-2014 to facilitate the
implementation of the vision, goals and
strategic priorities outlined in the NFSD.
It included proposals for an institutional
framework to drive sustainable
development, as well as a process to
monitor and evaluate progress made in
implementing the NSSD 1.

Phase Ill: 2011-2014 and onwards:
Although many relevant activities are
already being implemented, a formal
implementation of the Action Plan will
commence upon approval of the NSSD 1.
Implementation will be accompanied
by an ongoing process of monitoring
and evaluating the progress that is
being made in achieving the goal of a
sustainable society. This will also provide
feedback for a system of adaptive
management.

The evaluation of progress
regarding the implementation
of the NSSD 1 will inform the
NSSD 2 (2015-2020).

1.3 The South African vision
as outlined in the NFSD

The World Summit on Sustainable Deve-
lopment (WSSD), which was held in South
Africa in 2002, was tasked with reinvigorating
the global commitment to sustainable
development. It delivered a number of key
outcomes, including a political declaration
known as the Johannesburg Plan of
Implementation (JPOI), and a range of
partnership initiatives.

RIO+20

United Nations Conference
on Sustainable Development

Vettional Factegy for Suttoinalle DevelopmerA and Axion Plen (ASSP) Z01-ZOl4
  

According to Paragraph 162(b) of the

JPOI, “states should take immediate
steps to make progress in the formulation
and elaboration of national strategies
for sustainable development and begin
their implementation by 2005.” Following
the WSSD, Cabinet mandated the former
Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism and the former Department of
Foreign Affairs to formulate a National
Strategy for Sustainable Development.
The first phase of this process culminated
in the adoption of the NFSD by Cabinet in
June 2008.

Among other things, the NFSD spells out
South Africa's vision for a_ sustainable
society:

“South Africa aspires to be a
sustainable, economically prosperous
and self-reliant nation state that
safeguards its democracy by meeting
the fundamental human needs of
its people, by managing its limited
ecological resources responsibly for
current and future generations, and
by advancing efficient and effective
integrated planning and governance
through national, regional and global
collaboration.”

This vision is underpinned by a number of
principles:

Fundamental principles

The fundamental principles relate to the
following fundamental human rights that
are guaranteed in the Constitution of the
Republic of South Africa:

¢ Human dignity and social equity
¢ Justice and fairness

* Democratic governance

* Ahealthy and safe environment

Substantive principles

The substantive principles are based on
the following sustainable development
principles that are already enshrined in
South African law and that underscore
a_ systems approach to achieving
sustainable development:

* Natural resources must be used sus-
tainably.

* Socioeconomic systems are embed-
ded in and are dependent on ecosys-
tems.

* Basic human needs must be met to
ensure that the resources that are
necessary for long-term survival are
not destroyed for short-term gain.

Process principles

The process principles apply to the
implementation of the NFSD and the
NSSD 1, and include the following:

Integration and innovation
* Consultation and participation
¢ Implementation in a phased manner

The NFSD provides a valuable step in
defining key sustainable development
principles for the country. At the same
time, it is mindful of global challenges
and growth ideals. Because of certain
complex development considerations
- including the disturbing widening
of the gap between the rich and the
poor populations in the country - a
simple ‘triple bottom line’ approach to
sustainable development is insufficient.
This realisation has led to a broader
definition of sustainable development,
which, in accordance with the systems
approach to sustainability (see definition),
accepts that socio-political, economic
and ecosystem factors are embedded
within each other and are integrated
through the governance system that
holds all the other systems together in a
legitimate regulatory framework.

1.4 Purpose of the NSSD 1
and the Action Plan

The NFSD formed the first step of the
NSSD 1 process. This document provides
the National Strategy for Sustainable
Development and an Action Plan to
support the implementation of the NFSD. It
therefore provides a high-level roadmap
for strategic sustainable development. Its
intention is to provide public and private
sector organisations with guidance when
it comes to their own long-term planning,
as the development of sector- or subject-
specific strategies and action plans must
be consistent with the NSSD 1.

The NSSD 1 sets out key areas that are in
need of attention to ensure that a shift
takes place towards a more sustainable
development path. In this regard, the fol-
lowing key elements have been identified:

¢ Directing the development path to-
wards sustainability

¢ Changing behaviour, values and at-
titudes

¢ Restructuring the governance system
and building capacity

The Action Plan that forms part of the
strategy is formulated within the context
of the five strategic priorities that have
been identified in the NSSD 1. It sets out
the strategic goals, interventions and
indicators for each of these strategic
priorities.
 1.5 The NSSD 1's links with the National Planning Commission, the New Growth Path and the Industrial Policy Action Plan

South Africa is an emerging economy. While significant progress has been made since the first
democratic election of 1994, there are still significant developmental challenges that need to be
addressed in a manner that adheres to the principles of sustainable development.

The Development Indicators, which were
released by the Presidency at the end of
2010, provide measures based on trend
analyses, to assist in understanding the
impact of various government policies
and programmes. They are clustered
into ten themes: economic growth
and transformation, employment,
poverty, inequality, household and
community assets, health, education,
social cohesion, safety and security,
international relations and good
governance.

Based on information provided in the la-
bour force surveys of Statistics South Africa,
there are still high levels of inequality and
unemployment. In mid-2011, the unem-
ployment rate stood at 25.7%.

In terms of access to services by
households, the General Household
Survey, 2002-2009 of Statistics South
Africa revealed the following domestic
situation for 2009:

* 13.4% of households lived in informal
dwellings

* 7.6% of households did not have
access to water supply from a safe
source

* 27.8% of households did not have ac-
cess to sanitation

* 17.4% of households did not have ac-
cess to electricity

An additional challenge for the coun-
try is the increasing number of mater-
nal deaths. According to the Millennium
Development Goals Country Report for
2010, the maternal mortality ratio could
be as high as 625. Adult illiteracy is also
something that needs to be addressed.
According to Statistics South Africa, the
proportion of individuals over the age of
20 years who could be regarded as func-
tionally illiterate stood at 19.2% in 2010.

On the other hand, the South African
economy has certain characteristics in
common with a number of developed

countries. It is highly energy-intensive
and its per capita carbon emissions rank
among the highestin the world. According
to the Greenhouse Gas Inventory South
Africa, which was compiled under the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in May
2009, the country’s emissions increased
from 347 metric tons CO, equivalent
(Mt CO,e) in 1990 to 437 Mt CO,e in
2000. The trends analysis that informed
the NFSD revealed that the country’s
natural resource base is under severe
pressure. Many of its ecosystems are
already seriously degraded and South
Africa is likely to be significantly affected
by climate change. These point to the
fact that South Africa is currently on an
unsustainable development path.

Following the adoption of the NFSD,
South Africa (along with many other
countries) has been in an economic
recession due to the global financial
crisis. This has exacerbated many of the
socioeconomic problems.

 According to a report published by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) in 2008, the
prices of many staple foods nearly
doubled between 2005 and 2007 and
spiked in early 2008 (OECD, 2008). The
United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) reported in March 2009 that oil
prices had increased to almost US$150/
barrel in 2008 (UNEP 2009). Prof Tim
Jackson, economics commissioner
with the Sustainable Development
Commission in the United Kingdom,
predicts that oil scarcity is likely to
become a significant issue over the
next decade. He also notes that global
carbon emissions have risen by 40%
since 1990 (Jackson, 2009).

Climate change is expected to reduce
crop yields and alter rainfall patterns,
which will further exacerbate food and
water security. Pollution also poses a
threat to water scarcity and will have a
serious impact on people’s health. In
the opinion of Dr Rajendra K Pachauri,
chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) and co-recipient
of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, up to 1.2
billion people in Asia, 250 million Africans
and 81 million Latin Americans will be
exposed to increased water stress by
2020 (Pachauri, 2009).

These concerns do not only pose a threat
to achieving the goal of a sustainable
society in the longterm, but also challenge
the ability of government to meet its short-

term socioeconomic objectives and to
deliver on the Millennium Development
Goals. (An analysis of the links between
these threats and socioeconomic
variables is presented in the form of a
matrix in Annex A.)

In the face of the multiple international
crises, the UNEP proposed the Global
Green New Deal in a policy brief
published in March 2009 as part of its
Green Economy Initiative. In this report,
it recommends that countries view the
financial crisis as an opportunity to shift
their economies towards ecological
sustainability (UNEP. 2009). This report was
followed by the Green Economy Report
(Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to
Sustainable Development and Poverty),
which outlines priority areas of focus in
transitioning to a green economy (UNEP.
2011). This publication, together with
the work of many other agencies and
governments (including South Africa),
is set to inform a renewed sustainable
development vision for the next century.

In developing the the NSSD 1 as a strategy
to give effect to the NFSD, cognisance
is taken of the threats that are detailed
in Annex 1. The strategy contains the
following elements:

* Directing the development path to-
wards sustainability

* Changing behaviour, values and at-
titudes

¢ Restructuring the governance system
and building capacity

Contextual information and_ strategic
goals are provided for each of these ele-
ments in the subsections below. It should
be noted that these strategic goals are
overarching in nature and are therefore
relevant to each of the strategic priorities
that make up the NFSD. While not spe-
cifically mentioned in each set of inter-
ventions, it should be acknowledged
that gender mainstreaming is central to
poverty eradication and sustainable de-
velopment, and is therefore implicit in all
the proposed interventions.

The strategic goals of the NSSD 1 include
the following:

* Develop and promote new social and
economic goals based on ecological
sustainability, and build a culture that
recognises that socioeconomic sys-
tems are dependent on and embed-
ded within ecosystems.

¢ Increase awareness and understand-
ing of the value of ecosystem services
to human wellbeing.

* Ensure effective integration of sustain-
ability principles into all policies, plan-
ning and decision-making at national,
provincial and local levels.

* Ensure effective system-wide integra-
tion and collaboration across all func-
tions and sectors.

 

¢ Monitor, evaluate and report perfor-
mance and progress in respect of
ecological sustainability in relation to
socioeconomic goals.

2.1 Towards sustainable
development practices

South Africa’s current economic develop-
ment path is based primarily on maximising
economic growth — as measured by the
gross domestic product (GDP), particularly
through mining, manufacturing and agri-
cultural activities. This has resulted in an en-
ergy-intensive economy and an erosion of
the resource base: a situation that is clearly
unsustainable.

Historically, most of South Africa’s towns
and cities have been characterised by
urban sprawl. The predominant housing
model is detached, single family
houses. Moreover — largely as a result
of apartheid policies — communities
are not integrated, and low-income
housing and informal settlements are
generally located on the outskirts of
urban areas, far removed from job
opportunities and community services.
At the same time, safe and efficient
public transport is generally lacking.
There are also enormous inequalities
between the lifestyles of those living in
informal settlements (where there are
limited or no basic services) and the high
consumption levels characteristic of the
wealthy suburbs. This lack of access to
modern services often forces the poor to

Netional HHactegy, for Sustainable Development and Action Plan (ASSP) 20-2014
  

engage in practices that are detrimental
to both their health and the environment,
for example, the indoor burning of solid
fuels for cooking. This practice is not
consistent with a sustainable society.

The need to put new socioeconomic
objectives in place, particularly around
issues of equity, is clearly central to the
policies of the democratic government.
More recently, there has been some
recognition of the need for a more
radical redefinition of our development
path. The policy document outlining
South Africa’s response to the financial
crisis, Framework for South Africa’s
response to the international economic
crisis (Department of Trade and Industry,
2009), notes the need to emphasise
opportunities to green the economy. The
Global Green New Deal report of UNEP
(updated in September 2009 for the G20
Pittsburgh Summit) assigns South Africa a
Green Stimulus Ranking of 11% based on
a stimulus package of US$ 7.5 billion for
the period 2009-2011, which includes
the construction of railways, energy-
efficient buildings, and water and waste
management.

Tne Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan,
speaking at the UNEP Finance Initiative
Global Round Table on 22 October
2009, has also recognised that the cost
of a lack of action towards sustainable
development will far exceed the cost of

moving towards a low-carbon economy.
Furthermore, in his Medium-term Budget
Policy Statement Speech, delivered
on 27 October 2009, he _ identified
innovation (especially around climate
change challenges) as a priority.

2.2 Changing values and
behaviour

The purpose of human development is to
improve human wellbeing and quality of
life. Unfortunately, the predominant view
of ‘wellbeing’ is that it entails the accu-
mulation of physical goods and money
(things that are at the heart of our con-
sumerist society). However, only a rela-
tively small percentage of the population
— globally and nationally — has achieved
such prosperity. The majority still lives in
poverty. Thus, one of the major challen-
ges to building a sustainable society lies
in changing the current beliefs, values
and long-established practices of our so-
ciety. Many of these beliefs, values and
practices promote unsustainable patterns
of production and consumption, and in-
clude the perspective that human beings
are separate from and superior to nature,
and that human wellbeing can best be
enhanced by acquiring more physical
goods or money, as conspicuous con-
sumption is the best measure of success.

A key component of moving towards a
sustainable society is to change people's
perceptions of what constitutes ‘wellbeing’
and — based on this — to develop new
social goals. Efforts should be made to
increase awareness and to understand
the important role that ecosystems and
natural resources play in human wellbeing.
Efforts should also be made to introduce
incentives or disincentives to encourage
environmentally responsible behaviour.

The current structure of society often
prevents people from behaving in a
sustainable manner, even when they
would like to do so. This is illustrated by
the lack of safe and efficient public
transport, and the shortage of recycling
facilities. Attempts to change behaviour
must therefore be supported by the
availability of appropriate opportunities.
Changing values and behaviour is likely
to be a significant challenge and will
require a wide range of initiatives, from
regulatory mechanisms to educational
and awareness-raising campaigns. It will
require the involvement of government,
business and a number of civil society
organisations. If the level of awareness
that is required to bring about a change
in society's goals is to be achieved, the
support of a range of NGOs, churches,
youth groups, unions and cultural
organisations will have to be enlisted. It is
recommended that a massive outreach
programme be developed to promote
this strategy.

2.3 Restructuring the
governance system
and building capacity

The process of developing the NSSD 1
is driven by the Department of Environ-
mental Affairs (DEA) through consultation.
There are already a number of sectors
that have, to a greater or lesser extent,
incorporated sustainability criteria into
some or all of their policies, legislation,
strategies and action plans. In many
cases, however, implementation does
not seem to be effective for a number
of reasons. These include inadequate
resources, lack of management and
institutional capacity, and the absence
of technical capacity.

Initiatives need to be linked to an insti-
tutional framework with clear mandates
to ensure the effective coordination of
the priorities contained in the NSSD 1. Its
implementation needs to be linked to the
incorporation of principles of sustainabil-
ity into the policies, legislation, strategies
and action plans of government. This
includes the effective monitoring and
evaluation of progress towards achieving
a sustainable future. The contributions of
the private sector and civil society also
need to be managed.

In the NSSD 1, five strategic priorities and an associated Action Plan have been
developed within the context of sustainable development. Cognisance is taken of
emerging global issues and challenges, such as the financial crisis, the global climate
change and transitioning to a green economy. To remain within the prevailing and
flexible context, the strategic priorities of the NFSD have been reformulated as follows:

goals proposed for each priority. Key
interventions, targets and_ indicators
for each priority are outlined in each
tabulated Action Plan, while 20 headline
indicators have been identified to monitor
progress towards the implementation of
NSSD 1.

The indicators included in each tabulated
Action Plan provide a starting point for
the development of a set of national
sustainability indicators. They were
compiled from key strategic national
documents, including the Development
Indicators published by the Presidency,
the Environmental Sustainability Indicator
Technical Report, the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG) and the
12 key outcomes that give structure to
government's priorities for the MTSF.

Effective implementation of the NSSD 1
and the Action Plan will require an
institutional mechanism that facilitates
coordinated planning, monitoring
and evaluation of performance, and
measures progress towards sustainability
that supports ethical behaviour, and also
defines and underpins conductthatis right
or wrong at an individual and institutional
level (in the national, provincial and
local spheres of government). The
need to ensure that there is capacity
to implement sustainable development
remains critical across all sectors in South
African society, especially in the public
sector. The policies, frameworks, plans

3.1 Priority 1: Enhancing systems for integrated planning and implementation

and strategies need to be realigned
and improved to integrate sustainable
development considerations.

The following are the immediate goals
to enhance institutional systems and
capacity for the implementation of the

 3.2 Priority 2: Sustaining our ecosystems and using natural resources efficiently

Natural resources (water, soil and
biodiversity) form the basis of life,
economic activity and human wellbeing.
Functioning ecosystems generate
goods (natural products, such as water,
timber, flowers, food and medicines)
and services (waste recycling, water
and air purification, flood attenuation,
recreational opportunities and
carbon sequestration). The depletion
or wasteful use of natural resources,
and/or degradation of ecosystems
poses a threat to the achievement of
socioeconomic objectives. The analysis
undertaken during the development of
the NFSD concluded that South Africa's
natural resource base is under severe
pressure and that many of the country’s
ecosystems are degraded to the point
that threatens our wellbeing. This is of
particular concern given the important
role of natural systems in climate change
and adaptation, particularly for the most
vulnerable communities.

Key trends in respect of the state of South
Aftica’s natural resources include the
following:

South Africa has a relatively low annu-
al rainfall and water is extracted from
most of the country’s 22 major rivers to
supply the growing number of domes-
tic, agricultural and industrial users. It is
estimated that national water require-
ments will exceed availability by 2025.
This is exacerbated by the fact that
water quality has been seriously com-
promised in many areas.

There is limited agricultural land in
South Africa. Of the 122 million hec-
tares total land surface of the coun-
try, it is estimated that 16 million hec-
tares can be used for crop production
(7.5%). Soil erosion and the degrada-
tion of agricultural land through over-
exploitation and inappropriate and
unsustainable farming methods pose
a threat to food security. There are
many issues that affect agricultural
production, soil quality and erosion, as
well as lack of infrastructure, but water
is considered to be one of the most
important (Raga & Taylor).

About 34% of the country’s terrestrial
ecosystems, 82% of its main river eco-
systems and 65% of its marine biozones

are threatened, whereas 50% of the
wetlands have already been destroyed
and living marine resources are either
maximally or over-exploited.

¢ There are elevated levels of a variety of
pollutants in the atmosphere that, among
other things, are leading to a growing
incidence of respiratory problems.

If South Africa is to achieve the vision of a
sustainable society, these trends need to
be urgently reversed by working towards
achieving the following strategic goals
under Priority 2:

« Manage the use of all natural re-
sources to ensure their sustainability

* Protect and restore scarce and
degraded natural resources

¢ Prevent the pollution of air, water and
land resources so that community
and ecosystem health is not adversely
affected

* Avoid the irreversible loss and de-
gradation of biodiversity (marine,
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems)

 3.3 Priority 3: Towards a green economy

While the South African economy, as
measured by standard economic
indicators, is considered to be relatively
stable, there are a number of concerns
from an ecological — sustainability
perspective. These include the following:

* The economy is highly energy inten-
sive and includes a significant mining
sector (7.7% of GDP in 2006 and 6%
of the labour force in 2008)

¢ The natural resource base is under se-
vere pressure

¢ There is a national crisis in terms of
electricity supply

¢ There is widespread poverty, unem-
ployment and inequality

Agreen economy implies the decoupling
of resource use and environmental
impacts from economic growth. It is
characterised by substantially increased
investment in green sectors, supported
by enabling policy reforms. This implies
moving towards a stable, steady-state
economy “supplemented by conditions
that ensure distributional equity, establish
sustainable levels of resource throughput
and emissions, and provide for the
protection of critical natural capital”
(Jackson, 2009).

The South African approach is to ensure
that a green economy is supported by
a practical and implementable action

plan that recognises the importance
of building on existing best processes,
programmes, initiatives and indigenous
knowledge in key sectors, to shift towards
a_ resource-efficient, low-carbon and
pro-employment growth path. It also
recognises that government alone
cannot manage and fund a_ just
transition to a green economy, and that
the private sector and civil society must
play a fundamental role.

The Economic Sectors and Employment
cluster departments hosted the _ first
national Green Economy Summit from
18 to 20 May 2010 to gather valuable
insights on key focus areas and issues that
require attention in the short, medium and
long term. The summit was addressed by
the President, ministers, deputy ministers,
members of the Executive Council
(MECs) and Parliamentary Committee
chairpersons, as well as representatives
from the private sector, NGOs and labour
organisations.

In his address, the President highlighted
the fact that ecosystem failure will
seriously Compromise the country’s
ability to address its social and economic
priorities. He further reiterated that natural
resources are national economic assets,
and the economy depends heavily
on energy and mineral resources,
biodiversity, agriculture, forestry, fishing
and tourism. The President pointed

out that South Africa has no option but
to manage ifs natural resources in a
sustainable manner, and that it has
no choice but to be ecofriendly and
develop a green economy.

The Cabinet approved a number of key
supportive policies and this was the first
sign that the green economy was being
prioritised by government. The policies
in question included the Medium-term
Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2009-2014,
the Ten-year Innovation Plan, the revised
Industrial Policy Action Plan for 2010/11-
2012/13 (IPAP2), the revised Integrated
Resource Plan (IRP2) and New Growth
Path (NGP).

Through contributions from the various
sectors’ implementation plans, South
Africa is to develop a National Green
Economy Strategy. The implementation
of this strategy has a number of cross-
cutting roles and responsibilities and will
require work to ensure coherence and
coordination within government and
between social partners. The strategy will
also address crucial issues of technology,
innovation, localisation, manufacturing,
skills and funding, drawing from a variety
of potential sources, including the fiscus,
international funds, business and industry,
public-private partnerships (PPPs) and
other possible measures. The review
of relevant regulatory, macro- and
microeconomic policies and institutional

GREENING

frameworks will culminate in proposals
of the appropriate regulatory framework
to enable the development of sector
action plans and related green markets
and industries.

Guided by the outcomes of the National
Green Economy Summit, the environ-
ment sector has developed an imple-
mentation plan for this sector’s contribu-
tion to national green economy action.
The country began interventions and
fundraising nationally and internationally
for the implementation of the nine key
focus areas:

1. Resource conservation and manage-
ment
2. Sustainable waste management prac-
tices
3. Water management
4. Environmental sustainability, which
comprises the following:
(i) Greening and legacy projects:
Major events and tourism
(ii) Research, awareness, _ training,
skills development and knowledge
management

5. Green buildings and the built environ-
ment

6. Sustainable transport and infrastruc-
ture

7. Clean energy and energy efficiency

8. Agriculture, food production and for-
estry

9. Sustainable consumption and
production

The goals of a transition towards a green
economy should include green growth
contributions to economic growth
and employment, while preventing
environmental degradation and pollution,
loss of biodiversity and unsustainable
natural resource use.

Priority 3 (Towards a green economy)

ablers of implementation:

This is our prized yellow strelitzia named
in honour of President Mandela.

It is an unusual golden yellow colour
form of the normally orange species,
and it took us nearly 20 years of
selecting and careful cross-pollinating
to develop.

% “lam happiest when | am in the wild because | can listen ... as the poet says ‘inthe «
Z ‘Still air music lies unheard, in the rough mountains, beauty’s height unseen’.
lt always feel the force of that sentiment when | am in this environment. And | am
very happy that you have done me the honour of being associated with this
remarkable place.” President Nelson Mandela at Kirstenbosch, 21 August 1996.

 

To be sustainable, human settlements
must meet the different needs of their
residents, including housing, basic
services, community facilities, transport
and livelinood/job opportunities, while
at the same time, being sensitive to the
surrounding ecosystems and natural
resources. Given the large number of
poverty-stricken people still living in
informal settlements in South Africa,
building such communities is a priority.

For the past few years, this priority has been
guided by the Breaking New Ground Policy.
However, there have been significant
problems with housing and service delivery.
With the pressure of meeting quantitative
targets, large numbers of houses have
been built at the expense of quality and
durability, to the extent that thousands
of Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP) houses are currently
being demolished and rebuilt.

The limit of the available housing subsidy
has also, for the most part, precluded the
installation of eco-technologies, such
as solar water heaters, which generally
have higher upfront costs. Moreover,
the lack of long-term planning means
that there is insufficient infrastructure in
many areas (for example, wastewater
treatment plants) to meet the needs of
the rapidly growing urban population.
Insufficient attention has been given
to the environmental constraints and
opportunities of particular locations.

The following are the overall specific
strategic goals under Priority 4 that aim
to reduce poverty and provide a decent
quality of life for all:

¢ Enhance spatial planning to promote
social cohesion and integration between
communities, as well as between com-
munities and the natural environment

¢ Ensure universal access to basic and
community services

¢ Improve the quality of housing and
other structures to optimise resource
efficiency (energy, water, building
materials, etc.)

¢ Promote self-sufficiency, food security
and equitable access to natural
resources that support livelinoods

¢ Improve equity, security and social
cohesion

3.5 Priority 5: Responding effectively to climate change

Climate change is considered to be
among the most serious threats to global
sustainable development, if not the most
serious threat, with adverse impacts
expected on food and water security,
economic activity, human health,
physical infrastructure and natural
resources. These impacts will seriously
undermine efforts to achieve sustainable
development and the Millennium
Development Goals, particularly in
developing countries that are not only
the most vulnerable, but also the least
equipped to deal with climate change.

Conversely, addressing climate change
by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
and building resilient communities will
make a major contribution to achieving
asustainable society. Since terrestrial and
marine ecosystems play a_ significant
role in the carbon cycle, climate
change mitigation and adaptation must
include ecosystem-based _ solutions.
The protection of natural habitats is
particularly important as the poorest
people, who depend directly on natural
systems, are also the most vulnerable to
the effects of climate change.

Many years ago, government recog-
nised that climate change was real and
that it was a significant threat to the
country’s development. This was formally
acknowledged during the National
Climate Change Conference in 20085. In
November 2011, South Africa approved
a National Climate Change Response
white paper. This white paper presents
government's vision for an effective
climate change response and a long-
term, just transition to a climate-resilient
and lower-carbon economy and society.
This response is guided by principles set
out in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
the National Environmental Management
Act (NEMA), the Millennium Declaration
and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. The
development and implementation of
an effective climate change response
strategy is a priority for South Africa,
both in the short and longer terms.
Activities include continued participation
in the international climate change
negotiations with a view to concluding an
equitable, but ambitious climate change
agreement for the post-2012 period.
However, given the broader benefits

of mitigation and adaptation-related
activities, the National Programme on
Climate Change should be vigorously
pursued regardless of delays in the
international arena.

The following are the overall specific
goals under Priority 5 that relate to the
national climate change response:

¢ Decrease greenhouse gas emissions
to levels required by science/in line
with Cabinet-approved targets — with
particular emphasis on the energy
sector, which accounts for over 70%
of South Africa’s emissions

¢ Reduce dependency on fossil fuels
and enhance security of electricity
supply

¢ Build resilience to climate change in
communities

* Ensure that ecosystem resilience is not
disrupted

4.1 Rationale

A number of institutional arrangements
have been developed to support the
implementation of the NSSD 1, based
on a literature review on international
practice, interviews with stakeholders
and an assessment of what will be
possible in a South African context.
Among the key principles that informed
the development of these arrangements
were the need to do the following:

¢ Ensure simplicity without Compromis-
ing effectiveness

¢ Make use of and create linkages with
existing frameworks and mechanisms
in order to avoid the proliferation of
structures

e Learn from international practice

¢ Ensure high-level location and support
for the NSSD 1

4,2 Planning, implemen-
tation, monitoring,
evaluation and
reporting

The approach that is used for planning,
implementation, monitoring, evaluation
and reporting on progress towards the
achievement of sustainability targets
must be aligned with the existing
government-wide monitoring and
evaluation system. This alignment will
ensure that the practice of sustainable
development is integrated into the

routine work of government and that
performance against targets is subject
to established accounting systems,
including auditing by the Auditor-
General (AG). This is also in keeping with
advice contained in the guidelines of
the Development Assistance Committee
of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD),
Strategies for Sustainable Development,
that sustainable development plans
should be integrated into national
frameworks to ensure access to the
budget (OECD, 2001).

The Ministry of Water and Environmental
Affairs, through the Department of
Environmental Affairs (DEA) will be the
coordinating focal point, working with
relevant spheres of government, the
private sector, NGOs and civil society.
The DEA will establish and oversee the
National Committee on Sustainable
Development (NCSD), which will operate
at multiple levels to engage government
departments, civil society, the private
sector, academia, independent
reviewers and other stakeholders. The
function of the NCSD will be to ensure
that the goals of the NSSD 1 and the
Action Plan are implemented effectively.
These goals are the following:

* Develop and promote new social and
economic goals based on ecological
sustainability and build a culture that
recognises that socioeconomic sys-
tems are dependent on and embed-
ded in ecosystems

* Increase awareness and understand-
ing of the value of ecosystem services
to human wellbeing

« Ensure effective integration of sustain-
ability principles into all policies, plan-
ning and decision-making at national,
provincial and local levels

¢ Ensure effective system-wide integra-
tion and collaboration across all func-
tions and sectors

¢ Monitor, evaluate and report perfor-
mance and progress in respect of
ecological sustainability in relation to
socioeconomic goals

Tne DEA, in collaboration with the relevant
sector departments and_ stakeholders,
will initiate action towards’ the
implementation of the strategy through
the harmonised planning of programmes
and execution. The NCSD will have
different structures of engagement, for
example, an Interministerial Committee,
accounting officers and senior technical
management that may form task teams.
The institutional responsibilities for the
strategic management of the NSSD 1 are
illustrated in Figure 3.

The three key aspects of strategic
management are planning, implement-
ation and monitoring, and evaluation,
and reporting. Institutions that will take
responsibility for planning will include
the National Planning Commission
(NPC), government clusters, government
departments, private sector organisations
and NGOs. The relevant elements of the

NSSD 1, including goals, indicators and
programmes, will be reflected in the
strategic plans of these institutions and
organisations, with the implementation,
monitoring, evaluation and reporting of
the strategy enforced through strategic
plans.

All the parties that are responsible for
the implementation of the NSSD 1 will be
expected to report on their performance
against sustainability indicators, as part of
the normal reporting process. Research
institutions will play an important role in
gathering and analysing data that relates
 NN

 

to the NSSD 1. The NPC will provide a
long-term vision for the country, while the
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee of
the Presidency will play a key role in the
monitoring process.

The NCSD will be responsible for
the effective coordination of work
on sustainable development. _ This
committee will be established to drive
sustainable development, while making
use of existing structures for both horizontal
and vertical coordination. The main
vehicles for horizontal coordination at a
national level will be the Forum of South
African Heads of Departments (FOSAD)
and the cluster system, in particular the
Cluster for International Cooperation,
Trade and Security, Social Protection and
Community Development, the Human
Development Cluster, the Economic
Sectors and Employment Cluster, and
the Infrastructure Development Cluster.

The Director-General of the Department of
Environmental Affairs will be a member of
the FOSAD clusters that will carry through
the work of the NCSD. Other formal and
ad hoc sector-specific coordinating
structures, such as the Committee for
Environmental Coordination (CEC) of
the Environmental Sector, will also be
used in accordance with the National
Environmental Management Act on
cooperative governance.

Vertical coordination with provinces
will be take place through meetings of

MINTHEC (Ministerial Technical Commit-
tee) and MINMEC (Ministers and Execu-
tive Committee). Performance against
sustainability targets will be included in
discussions that take place during these
forums. Coordination with local govern-
ment will be facilitated through the South
African Local Government Association
(SALGA) and the Department of Cooper-
ative Governance and Traditional Affairs
(COGTA).

4.2.1 Planning for sustainable
development
Sustainable development will be

integrated into the national planning
system. Figure 3 provides an illustration
of the hierarchy of planning frameworks
to which government departments at
all levels need to respond. Sustainability
indicators and targets will be integrated
into these planning frameworks, starting
with the national vision and _ strategic
plan that will cover a longer period,
possibly 15 years, according to the
revised Green Paper on the NPC.
This also takes care of the need for
intergenerational sustainability targets.
Working with the NCSD, the Ministry of
Water and Environmental Affairs will
ensure that sustainable development is
incorporated into the short- and long-
term vision of government processes by
engaging with the NPC.

Securing the prominence of sustainable
development indicators and targets in

government's five-year MISF ensures
that sustainable development is placed
at the centre of government planning.
It also ensures that performance
against sustainability targets is tracked
and reported on as part of regular
development indicator reporting to
National Treasury and the Presidency.

Government’s medium-term
planning

The five-year strategic plans that are
developed by national and provincial
departments are to be informed, among
others, by the national vision (Vision
2030) and strategic plan of the NPC, the
MITSF, the National State of the National
Address (SONA), the Provincial Growth
and Development Strategy (PGDS) and
the State of the Province addresses
(SOPA). These five-year strategic plans
should include sustainability indicators
and targets as core indicators agreed
to by each of the government sectors,
as required by the Treasury Guidelines for
Strategic Planning. In their interactions
with municipalities, and their strategic
planning oversight roles, provincial
governments must therefore ensure that
municipal integrated development plans
(IDPs) include sustainability indicators.

Annual planning
Inthe annual SONA and SoPA, the President

and premiers highlight the centrality of
sustainable development as directed

by the national vision and strategic plan,
and the MITSF. National and provincial
departments then have to_ include
sustainable development — indicators
and targets in their annual performance
plans (APPs), while municipalities must
include them in their annual service
delivery budget implementation plans
(SDBIP), which are linked to their IDPs.

Spatial planning

Planning of September 2009, national
spatial guidelines are identified as
important tools for bringing about
coordinated government action and
alignment. Internationally, spatial plan-
ning instruments are increasingly being
used to achieve alignment between
the actions of different sectors and the
various spheres of government. South
Africa has an established spatial planning
framework, through which alignment
can readily be achieved. The country’s
overarching framework is provided
in the National Spatial Development
Perspective (NSDP).

In the development of their PGDS, the
provinces must include a spatial plan
(the Provincial Spatial Development
Framework). Similarly, local governments,
in the development of their IDPs, must
also include a spatial plan (the Spatial
Development Framework or Spatial
Development Plan). This means that
both provincial and local governments

need to align their development plans
and _ spatial development frameworks
with the national perspective. In this way,
coordination, alignment and integrated
action with respect to the development
of a spatial economy can be achieved,
and the integration of sustainability
principles in the national strategic
plan, the PGDS and the IDPs of local
government will ensure that sustainability
is also reflected in spatial planning.

4.2.2 Implementation of
sustainable development
The implementation of sustainable

development action willbe decentralised
through the strategic plans of all soheres
of government, public entities, civil
society, organised labour and business.

4.2.3 Monitoring, evaluation and
reporting for sustainable
development

The key to effective monitoring, evalu-
ation and reporting will be the
establishment of baselines for alll
sustainability indicators. The performance
against sustainability indicators — will
be monitored through quarterly non-
financial reports. These reports will have
to be linked to programme _ outputs
or strategic objectives contained in
the APPs of government departments,
municipalities and public entities.

The NCSD will participate in the review
of the departmental strategic plans and
APPs and will conduct a periodic analysis
of reports with a view to keeping track of
the country’s overall progress towards

achieving sustainability targets. The
NCSD will also analyse annual reports for
the same purpose.

Because the system will be integrated into
the government's reporting and accounting
cycle, performance against sustainability
targets will be subject to auditing by the
Auditor-General. A special function of audit
performance on sustainable development
should be established within the office of the
Auditor-General, focusing on the monitoring
of sustainability outputs, as is done in other
countries such as Canada. Oversight
bodies, such as Parliament, provincial
legislatures and municipal councils, will
hold the executive accountable for delivery
against sustainability indicators and targets,
including associated spending.

Other sources of information for the
country’s progress towards achieving
sustainable development will be the
surveys conducted periodically by
Statistics South Africa. As the entity
responsible for South Africa’s official
statistics, Statistics South Africa will be
tasked with the tracking and reporting of
sustainability indicators. (Statistics South
Africa is in the process of developing
environmental accounting indicators
that will cover the different sectors, such

as water and energy) These indicators
should be considered in the finalisation
of sustainability indicators. The periodic
South Africa Environmental Outlook
Report (SAEOR), the provincial and
municipal State of the Environment
Report and other similar reports will be
important sources of information.

The NCSD will take responsibility for
distilling information from these reports,
verifying their accuracy and validity, and
producing annual reports to be presented
to Parliament and the United Nations
(UN). The NCSD will seek certification from
Statistics South Africa in accordance
with the South African Statistical Quality
Assessment Framework. This framework
sets criteria for certification, including
the relevance, accuracy, timeliness,
accessibility, methodological soundness
and integrity of produced statistics. The
NCSD will be a member of the National
Statistics System.

Reporting on sustainable development
by the private sector will be encouraged

through incorporation of sustainability
into the King Code for Corporate
Governance, including the _ triple

bottom-line reporting requirement of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The
NCSD will initiate discussions with private
sector representative organisations to
ensure reporting. Industry organisations
could be required to produce annual

reports on the contribution of various
sectors to sustainable development.
Civil society will play a key role in the
monitoring of the government and
private sector's performance towards
the achievement of sustainability targets.
Part of this role will be exercised through
the establishment of a civil society or
NGO forum and other multi-stakeholder
consultative forums.

The NCSD will commission regular
external evaluations on South Africa's
performance in_ relation to the
achievement of sustainability. In addition,
sustainability will be included in the
periodic development indicator reports
and five-year reviews that are conducted
by the Presidency. As part of the ongoing
evaluation of sustainable development
performance, the NCSD will commission
periodic spending reviews as spending
could be a good indicator of the level of
commitment.

In order to ensure that there is learning
and adaptation on sustainable
development, the NCSD will convene
periodic multi-stakeholder sustainable
development review conferences.
(Canada does these reviews every three
years.) In addition, a research network on
sustainable development, constituted by
research institutions (both government
and non-state, including academia), will
be established.

4.3 The role of government
in sustainable
development

The Ministry of Water and Environmental
Affairs, specifically the Department of
Environmental Affairs (DEA), through
dedicated internal units, is the
coordinating focal point for sustainable
development both nationally and
internationally.

National arrangement

The DEA has established a_ national
focal point unit that coordinates the
country’s implementation of the national
sustainability vision and multilateral
agreements (MEAs). This unit will work with
the NCSD, government departments, civil
society, organised labour and business
to ensure that there is effective planning
and implementation of sustainable
development throughout all spheres
of government, public entities and the
private sector. At the same time, it will
promote capacity-building to enhance
the effectiveness of government agencies
to empower communities on sustainability.

International arrangement

The DEA has established an international
focal point unit to coordinate the country’s
participation in MEAs. The unit is the focal
point of the Commission on Sustainable
Development (CSD) and participates on

international issues related to sustainable
development. The unit has to ensure that
international policy decisions and activities
are tailored to support and implement
sustainable development at the national
level. Working with the NCSD, government

departmenis, civil society, organised
labour and business, the unit will ensure
participation within the United Nations
systems on sustainable development
issues. The country submits biennial
progress reports on concrete progress
achieved with the implementation of
internationally agreed goals on sustainable
development to the CSD.

4.4 The role of the private
sector in sustainable
development

As suppliers of societal goods and
services, the private sector has a
pivotal contribution to make in pursuit of
sustainable development objectives and
targets. Within the context of sustainable
development, a key principle that will be
adopted in relation to the private sector is
that of partnership with government and
civil society. To this end, industry bodies
will be invited to send representatives
to the consultative forum that will be
established for the implementation of the
NSSD 1. In addition, the private sector,
via industry bodies, will be encouraged
to do the following:

* Identify sustainable development
goals and actions that are relevant to
their sectors

* Agree on sectoral sustainability indica-
tors and targets in line with those con-
tained in the national strategy

* Discuss and agree on monitoring and
reporting mechanisms for sustainable
development (This might entail a re-
quirement that companies submit an-
nual progress reports on their activities
and progress towards contributing to
sustainability targets.)

* Submit annual industry sector sustain-
able development progress reports to
the NCSD

* Contribute to funding sustainable de-
velopment in partnership with govern-
ment and donors to support projects
and initiatives aimed at supporting
sustainable development

4.5 The role of civil
society in sustainable
development

Civil society, as represented by NGOs,
community-based organisations (CBOs)
and labour, has a key role to play in
advancing sustainable development in
South Africa. This is the sector that tends
to pay the highest price for unsustainable
development practices.

munity-based sustainable development
projects

¢ Participate in research on sustainable
development

* Serve as a watchdog, tracking the
performance of government and the
private sector against sustainability tar-
gets (This role will also include lobbying
and advocacy for sustainable deve-
lopment.)

4.6
Science and
technology

The National
Research and
Development
Strategy estab-
lished a new set
of technology
(biotechnology, information

technology for advanced

platforms
technology,
manufacturing, technology for and from

natural resource sectors, and techno-
logy for poverty reduction) and a new
set of science missions (in areas in which
South Africa has an obvious geographic
advantage, such as astronomy, human
palaeontology and biodiversity, as well
as in areas in which South Africa has a

clear knowledge advantage, such as
indigenous knowledge and deep mining).
These missions and platforms were
expanded under the Ten-Year Innovation
Plan to include “grand challenges” in
space science and technology, energy
security, human and social dynamics
in development, global change, and
the bioeconomy. The responsibility for
addressing the grand challenges is spread
across many government departments.

The Ten-Year Innovation Plan also set long-
term goals based on these challenges.
These included the following:

* Becoming one of the top three
emerging economies in the global
pharmaceutical industry, based on
the innovative use of South Africa’s

indigenous knowledge and _tich
biodiversity
* Deploying satellites that provide

a range of scientific, security and
specialised services for all soheres of
government, as well as the public and
the private sector

* Achieving a 25% share of the global
hydrogen and fuel cell market with
novel platinum group metal catalysts

* Becoming a world leader in climate
science, and responding effectively
to the multiple challenges associated
with global and climate change

* Meeting the 2014 Millennium
Development Goal to halve poverty

The achievement of — sustainable
development priorities require
targeted science and _ technology

interventions and the development
of strategic partnerships with other
government departments, — industry,
research institutions and communities.
Interventions include high potential
research and development (R&D)-led
industrial development programmes,
technology support programmes
for industry, the introduction of new
approaches to government service
delivery and planning, strengthening
science-based policy develooment
and decision-making, demonstrating
technology-led opportunities for creating
sustainable jobs and wealth creation,

and strengthening the contribution
of technology in sustainable human
settlements.

The key contributing socioeconomic
strategic objectives include the following:

* Technology for poverty reduction

* Science and technology capability
for sustainable development and a
green economy

* Promoting growth in public and pri-
vate sector investments in science
and technology, and R&D

* Supporting the development of new
industries in advanced manufactur-
ing, chemicals, advanced metals
and information and communication
techonolgies (ICTs)

 

4.7 Financing of sustainable
development

The financing of sustainable development
and its activities will be sourced from the
private sector and national fiscus through
the national budgeting process. This is
because sustainable development will
gradually become an integral part of
the private sector and government's
planning and spending. In addition to
this, other funding mechanisms from the
private sector, donors and funds from the
economy, for instance, public-private
partnerships, will be attracted. National
Treasury is already working on the market-
based instruments and environmental
fiscal reforms that serve as a_ further
source of sustainable development
financing.

 

Netional HHactegy, for Sustainable Development and Action Plan (ASSP) 20-2014
  

Urgent action is required to direct the

development path of the country
towards sustainability, particularly in light
of the potential consequences of climate
change, the financial recession, job
losses and declining natural resources. It
is acknowledged at an international level
that the poorest and most vulnerable
are likely to be affected most by climate
change. For this reason, it is imperative
that active and urgent interventions are
taken to deliver on social objectives, while
ensuring that the natural resources on
which a decent quality of life depends
are managed to ensure their long-
term sustainability. Thus, the NSSD 1 and
Action Plan must receive priority, and
achievements against its targets must be
assessed through the application of the
relevant indicators.

This NSSD 1 puts into action the NFSD
that requires the nation as a whole to
increasingly share in the common vision.

All sectors, including all ele-
ments of the government and
civil society, organised labour
and business, need to take part
in the social contract to imple-
ment the NFSD, the NSSD 1 and
the Action Plan for 2011-2014.

Simple actions need to be promoted on a
largescale. As understanding of sustainable
development increases, and it becomes
clear that this is the key mechanism for
building capacity and governance to
achieve human development based on
sustainable production and consumptions
systems, government and society across
all soheres and sectors will approach and
address the issues identified in this strategy
with the seriousness they deserve.

When deciding on resource allocation
and in making policy choices, the
executive should seek to give effect to
the vision of sustainability. The strategic
plans, priorities and commitments should
be clearly articulated. While sustainability
concerns impact on all facets of life, we
should keep our focus on mainstreaming
the five identified priority areas for strategic
intervention:

* Enhancing systems for integrated plan-
ning and implementation

* Sustaining our ecosystems and using
natural resources efficiently

* Towards a green economy
* Building sustainable communities

* Responding effectively to climate
change

These priority areas should, over
the coming three to five years,
serve as catalysts for policy
change that will facilitate the
achievement of the desired
ideal state as articulated in the
national vision for sustainable
development.
