Definition

The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human
systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial
opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate
adjustment to expected climate and its effects.

The ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to
potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to
consequences.

Refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and
that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change
may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, such as modulations
of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the
composition of the atmosphere or in land use.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to
transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and
ensure food security in changing climate. CSA aims to tackle three main objectives:
sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, adapting and building
resilience to climate change, and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas
emissions, where possible.

Ecological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver
valuable services to people, such as water and climate regulation, soil formation and
disaster risk reduction (SANBI 2019a)

An ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living
environment and the interactions within and between them. The components
included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for
which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in
others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems
are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to the
entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key
organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment.

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystems to
support communities to adapt to life in a less predictable climate system (SANBI
2019b)

The surroundings within which humans exist and that are made up of i) the land,
water and atmosphere of the earth; ii) micro-organisms, plant and animal life; iii)
any part or combination of i) and ii) and the interrelationships among and between
them; and iv) the physical, chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and

The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some
cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an
economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution (OECD 2006)

The gaseous constituents of the global atmosphere, both
natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re -emit infrared radiation.

A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse
gases (GHGs). This report also assesses human interventions to reduce the sources
of other substances which may contribute directly or indirectly to limiting climate
change, including, for example, the reduction of particulate matter emissions that
can directly alter the radiation balance (e.g., black carbon) or measures that control
emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, Volatile Organic Compounds and
other pollutants that can alter the concentration of tropospheric ozone which has
an indirect effect on the climate.

Natural capital are natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs
and environmental services for economic production (OECD 2005).

Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as
land use/landcover. The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only
one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing
characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes the fact that not only the long-term
concentration levels but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome
are of interest.

The ability of a social, economic or ecological system to absorb disturbances while
retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-
organisation and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.

A dynamic process that guarantees the persistence of natural and human systems in
an equitable manner.

The integration of social, economic and environmental factors into planning,
implementation and decision-making so as to ensure that development serves
present and future generations(Republic of South Africa 1998).

A system-wide change that requires more than technological change through
consideration of social and economic factors that, with technology, can bring about
rapid change at scale.

The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability
encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or
susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.

 1. Introduction

South Africa is experiencing significant effects of climate change particularly as a result of increased
temperatures and rainfall variability. The observed rate of warming has been 2 C per century or even
higher — more than twice the global rate of temperature increase for the western parts and the
northeast (DEA 2017, 72). There is evidence that extreme weather events in South Africa are
increasing, with heat wave conditions found to be more likely, dry spell durations lengthening slightly
and rainfall intensity increasing. Climate zones across the country are already shifting, ecosystems and
landscapes are being degraded, fires are becoming more frequent, and overused natural terrestrial
and marine systems are under stress (DEA 2017). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (ARS), climate change is likely to increase the frequency and
magnitude of many extreme events and will certainly increase the risk of slow-onset events such as
sea level rise and drought (IPCC 2013).

Climate change has the potential to redress the gains made on the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and impede the country’s ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
also poses risks to opportunities for socioeconomic development. There is increasing international
recognition that strong and sustainable socioeconomic development can reduce vulnerability to
climate change and ensure resilience (UN 2016; Chaudhury 2017). Despite the advancements that
have been made in South Africa, there are still many South Africans that live below the poverty line.
These and other vulnerable groups, including the elderly, sick, children, and disabled, will be affected
the most by climate change. In terms of gender, women in South Africa are still more vulnerable to
the impacts of poverty and face different challenges to men in the workplace, in society and at home
(Commission for Gender Equality n.d.). Climate change is one such challenge that women will
experience differently to men.

Adaptation to climate change presents South Africa with an opportunity to transform both the health
and the economy, to strengthen the social and spatial fabric, and to become more competitive in the
global marketplace (Segal and Cloete, 2012; Western Cape Government, 2018). However, systemic
changes are required in order to minimise the impacts of climate change. Technological advancements
that consider social and economic factors can assist in making these transformative changes.

The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (NCCAS) provides a common vision of climate
change adaptation and climate resilience for the country, and outlines priority areas for achieving this
vision. The NCCAS’s vision draws on South Africa’s National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP)
(DEA 2011), the National Development Plan (NDP) (NPC 2011), the National Strategy for Sustainable
Development (NSSD) (DEA 2011b), the adaptation commitments included in its Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), sector adaptation plans, provincial adaptation plans and municipality
adaptation plans. It should be noted that since the NCCAS is specifically focussed on adaptation to
climate change, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) is dealt with in other policy
documents. It is however acknowledged that adaptation and mitigation that adaptation action and
mitigation action impact on one another. In some cases, adaptation and mitigation action are mutually
supportive and in other cases mitigation action and adaptation action are mutually contradictory.
 The NCCAS builds upon principles in other pieces of legislation and policy in South Africa, including the
National Environmental Management Act, the guiding act for environmental issues, and the
Constitution, particularly Section 24, that speaks to the rights to a safe and healthy environment.

The NCCAS is an important step forward for South Africa, as it:

e Acts as a common reference point for climate change adaptation efforts in South Africa in the
short to medium-term’, providing guidance across all levels of government, sectors, and
stakeholders affected by climate variability and change.

e Provides a policy instrument in which national climate change adaptation objectives for the
country can be articulated to provide overarching guidance to all sectors of the economy.

e Facilitates the degree to which development initiatives at different levels of government and
business integrate and reflect critical climate change adaptation priorities, and thus inform
resource allocation by the various stakeholders towards climate change resilience.

e@ Guides stronger coherence and coordination on climate change adaptation activities between
different institutions and levels of government.

e Supports South Africa in meeting its international obligations by defining the country’s
vulnerabilities, plans to reduce such vulnerabilities and leverage opportunities, outlining the
required resources for such action, whilst demonstrating progress on climate change adaptation.

The NCCAS also serves as South Africa’s National Adaptation Plan and fulfils South Africa’s
commitment to its international obligations as outlined in the Paris Agreement under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The NCCAS will be used as the basis for
meeting South Africa’s obligations in terms of the adaptation commitments outlined in the NDC. The
NCCAS is a ten-year plan that will be reviewed every five years.

The NCCAS is divided into sets of strategic objectives, strategic interventions and strategic outcomes
with associated actions. The document is directed not only at national government departments, but
speaks to South African society as a whole, including the key relevant sectoral institutions, provincial
governments and municipalities, and non-governmental entities including the private sector, the
research community and civil society.

The National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP) identifies the following priority adaptation
related sectors: water, agriculture and commercial forestry, health, biodiversity and ecosystems,
human settlements (urban, rural and coastal), and disaster risk reduction and management (DEA
2011a). The NCCAS goes beyond these sectors to include transportation and infrastructure, energy,
mining, oceans and coast.

It should however be noted that the NCCAS is a national strategy and as such does not go into detail
of how adaptation will take place in the many sectors impacted by climate change.

2 Time frames for the NCCAS are: Short term 1-3 years, Medium term 4-10 years, Long term - More than 10
years.

 2. Context

The purpose of this chapter is to contextualise the NCCAS within the international climate change
regime and leverage alignment with South African policies, legislation and other strategic frameworks.
Furthermore, it highlights the projected climatic changes South Africa is expected to experience and
some of the key impacts on different sectors.

2.1. International Context

The 2019 edition of the Global Risk Report by the World Economic Forum highlights environmental
risks such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, and the failure to respond to climate change
effectively, as among the top risks to the globe in terms of impact and likelihood (WEF 2019). Climate
change was ranked first by Global Risks Perception Survey respondents as an “underlying driver of
developments in the global risks landscape” (WEF 2019, 13). In 2018, a report on global warming was
released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC 2018). This watershed report
highlights the urgency of the climate change challenge and states that the current commitments by
countries across the globe are not enough to prevent an increase of 1.5 degrees in global
temperatures. It highlights that the situation is worse than previously thought and that an increase in
1.5 degrees will have a greater impact than was estimated (IPCC 2018). There are a number of global
agreements and decisions that South Africa has participated in that aim to respond to and prepare for
the impacts of climate change.

In particular, South Africa is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) which aims to achieve the ‘stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [human induced] interference
with the climate system’ (UN 1992, 4). Under the UNFCCC, it is envisaged that: 'Such a level should be
achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to
ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed ina
sustainable manner’ (UN 1992, 4). The two key Conference of Parties (COPs) to the UNFCCC that
prioritised the importance of climate change adaptation were COP16 held in Cancun in 2010 and
COP21 held in Paris in 2015. COP16 resulted in the adoption of the Cancun Adaptation Framework,
which placed climate change adaptation on the same level of importance as climate change mitigation
for the first time. It also established the National Adaptation Plan process (UNFCCC 2011, 4—7). The
Cancun Adaptation Framework laid the foundation for the Paris Agreement, an outcome of COP21.
The Paris Agreement elevates the importance of climate change adaptation through the
establishment of a ‘global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience
and reducing vulnerability to climate change’ and provides extensive guidance on how countries
should approach adaptation as a priority (UN 2015a, Article 7). As a signatory, South Africa is required
to compile a set of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which outline the country’s
contributions to the global goals to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the
impacts of climate change (UN 2015a, Article 7). South Africa’s goals regarding adaptation outlined in
its NDC document are:

@ Goal 1: Develop a National Adaptation Plan, and begin operationalization as part of

implementing the NCCRP for the period from 2020 to 2025 and for the period 2025 to 2030;

11
 @ Goal 2: Take into account climate considerations in national development, sub-national and
sector policy frameworks for the period 2020 to 2030;?

@ Goal 3: Build the necessary institutional capacity for climate change response planning and
implementation for the period 2020 to 2030;

e@ Goal 4: Develop an early warning, vulnerability and adaptation monitoring system for key
climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas for the period 2020 to 2030, and reporting in
terms of the National Adaptation Plan with rolling five-year implementation periods;

@ Goal 5: Development of a vulnerability assessment and adaptation needs framework by 2020
to support a continuous presentation of adaptation needs; and

e@ Goal 6: Communication of past investments in adaptation for education and awareness as well
as for international recognition (DEA 2015a, 3-6).

In the same year that the Paris Agreement was signed, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
was adopted, along with a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs support the
Paris Agreement as climate change is specifically highlighted under SDG 13: ‘Take urgent action to
combat climate change and its impacts’, and features across many of the other SDGs, because of its
cross-cutting nature (UN 2015b, Goal 13). SDG 13 specifically mentions targets relating to
strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity which align directly with the adaptation goal in the
Paris Agreement (UN 2015b, Goal 13). In addition, The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
2015-2030, adopted on 18 March 2015, notes that climate change is one of the ‘underlying disaster
risk drivers’, and that climate change can exacerbate the seriousness of a disaster (UNISDR 2015, p10).
Preparing for climate related disaster and building resilience are key priorities in the Sendai
Framework.

Another international agreement that contributes to the global climate change adaptation response
is the decision on Biodiversity and Climate Change that was adopted in 2016 at the Conference of the
Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Cancun (UNEP 2016, 34). The Decision
encourages all Parties to take into account the importance of protecting biodiversity, preserving
ecosystems, and using ecosystem-based approaches, when developing their NDCs. It also encourages
the integration of ecosystem-based approaches into climate change adaptation, mitigation, disaster
risk reduction and other strategic plans (UNEP 2016, 34). Finally, the Global Framework for Climate
Services was developed to help guide nations, especially those most vulnerable, to prepare and adapt
to climate change through the development and use of science-based climate information in policy,
planning and practice (WMO 2016).

2.2. African Context

Africa is likely to experience changes in climate earlier than other regions, and therefore adaptation
measures are urgently required on the continent (Giordano and Bassini 2019; Besada and
Sewankambo 2009). Africa’s Adaptation Gap 2: Technical Report (2013) notes that the costs of
adaptation in Africa could increase to USD 100 billion/year by 2050 in a world that experiences more
than 4 degrees Celsius warming by 2100. Increased funds from developed countries for adaptation in

12
 African countries would help to fund these costs. However, finances for adaptation are required from
continental and national levels as well (UNEP 2015, iv).

The Southern African Development Community’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (CCSAP)
(SADC 2015) emphasises the need for enhanced climate change adaptation responses in Africa due to
the wide range of pressing vulnerabilities. The CCSAP aims to coordinate regional and national climate
change responses in Africa, and to ‘climate proof’ SADC’s policies, strategies and protocols (SADC
2015).

2.3. National Context

Although the South African post-apartheid political and policy landscape looks markedly different
from its apartheid predecessor, the legacy of apartheid is still very evident from a developmental
vantage point. South Africa remains a dual economy with one of the highest Gini Coefficients in the
world, perpetuating both inequality and exclusion. The continued social and economic exclusion of
millions of South Africans, reflected in high levels of poverty and inequality, has been identified as
South Africa's biggest challenge by the National Planning Commission’s diagnostic report (NPC nd). In
terms of gender inequality, the report also notes that poverty is higher in woman-headed households
and that women still continue to earn less than men (NPC nd).

The South African economy is dependent on primary sectors such as agriculture and mining,
particularly minerals extractives, which are natural resource dependent and energy intensive, with
energy generation being very important as it is also subject to climate variability and change.
Therefore, changes in climate are predicted to exacerbate these challenges, as increased
temperatures, rainfall variability and increased coastal storms and sea level rise will have direct
impacts on South Africa’s natural resources and infrastructure, affecting food security and health,
threatening water and coastal resources, and impacting on development. These impacts will be
especially felt by the poor, as they will be more exposed to them and have fewer resources to cope
with these impacts. Climate change is therefore predicted to result in further widening of the gap
between the rich and poor (Ziervogel et al. 2014; Chikulo 2014). Climate change impacts are however,
already happening in South Africa with increased storms, drought conditions and temperature
increases being felt across different parts of the country.

The National Development Plan (NDP) of South Africa seeks to eliminate poverty, deliver
environmental protection and promote economic development by 2030. However, the NDP does not
test the sensitivity of achieving these goals in light of climate change and variability. Finance set aside
for development needs to incorporate climate change so that infrastructure and communities are
resilient to future climate impacts. Furthermore, climate change needs to be mainstreamed into
budgetary processes in all spheres of government.

South Africa has, however, made progress in developing a plan that responds to and prepares for the
impacts of climate change. The National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP), published in 2011,
prioritizes both climate change mitigation and adaptation in moving towards a climate-resilient and
lower-carbon economy and society (DEA 2011). The overarching approach to adaptation, as identified
in the NCCRP, focuses on the development of adaptation responses that are flexible to changing

13
 conditions, that take local context and local knowledge into account and that are informed by rigorous
research. The NCCRP identifies a set of key adaptation related sectors including water, health, human
settlements, agriculture and commercial forestry, biodiversity and ecosystems, and disaster risk
reduction and management, and advocates the inclusion of climate change into plans for these sectors
(DEA 2011). Since the development of the NCCRP, considerable progress has been made in developing
adaptation policies, plans and strategies in various sectors and spheres of government, including the
development of climate adaptation plans in local and provincial government.

A sector where significant strides have been made in the integration of climate change adaptation is
disaster management. The Disaster Management Amendment Act, 2015 (Act No. 16 of 2015), is a
critical piece of legislation that directly responds to climate change adaptation. The Amendment Act
assigns responsibility to national, provincial and local spheres of government to invest in disaster risk
reduction and climate change adaptation interventions for their respective jurisdictions. Each organ
of state is required to develop disaster management plans that include climate change risks and
responses.

3. Strategic Focus

This chapter outlines the vision, strategic objectives, strategic interventions and strategic outcomes of
the NCCAS.

3.1. Vision

To transition to a climate resilient South Africa, which will follow a sustainable
development path, guided by anticipation, adaptation and recovery from a changing
climate and environment to achieve our development aspirations.

3.2. Principles and key elements of adaptation and climate resilience
The guiding principles for the implementation of the NCCAS are outlined below:

 

Guiding Principle Description

 

A country-driven approach The development and implementation of the NCCAS will be driven by South
Africa and the NCCAS will be coordinated with national sustainable

 

 

 

 

19
 development objectives, plans, policies, programmes.

 

Based on best available science
and traditional knowledge

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will be based on best
available science on observed climate and projected climate changes as
well as relevant traditional knowledge on climate impacts and potential
responses.

 

Participatory, bottom up
approach

A wide range of stakeholders, including government, communities, civil
society organisations, research community and private sector actors will be
involved in the development and implementation of the NCCAS.

 

People-centred

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will place people, their
needs and their rights at the forefront and serve their physical,
developmental, cultural and social interests equitably.

 

Equity

The development and implementation of the NCCAS should support and
promote equity in South Africa.

 

Gender-responsive

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the
participation of women, take gender differences in vulnerability to climate
change into account, address the needs and priorities of both women and
men and will not exacerbate gender inequalities.

 

Consideration of vulnerable
groups

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the
participation of vulnerable groups and build resilience and adaptive
capacity of the most vulnerable people such as women, and especially
poor and/or rural women; children, especially infants and child-
headed families; the aged; the sick; and the physically challenged.

 

Environmental support for
climate adaptation

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the
protection of ecosystems and biological diversity because of the role they
play in supporting South Africa's adaptation to climate change.

 

Address capacity gaps

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the
development of capacity in climate change adaptation throughout South
Africa.

 

Facilitate mainstreaming of
adaptation

The development and implementation of the NCCAS will promote the
integration of adaptation in the policies and planning of sectors as well as
all three spheres of government.

 

Continuous, progressive,
iterative process

The NCCAS will be have a strong Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System
and further iterations of the NCCAS will be influenced by outcomes of M&E.

 

Transformative change

 

 

The implementation of the NCCAS requires transformative change. This
entails advancements in technology that consider social and economic
factors that result in system-wide change.

 

3.3. Strategic Objectives

As different departments and spheres of government continue to develop and strengthen their own
comprehensive adaptation strategies, it is critical that they all reflect a shared vision. A common
reference point is needed to help align ongoing efforts across the country. This document — South
Africa’s NCCAS — is intended to be the cornerstone for climate change adaptation in the country and
to reflect a unified, coherent, cross-sectoral, economy-wide approach to climate change adaptation.

20

 
 It outlines priority areas for adaptation, both to guide adaptation efforts and to inform resource
allocation. The strategic objectives of the NCCAS are as follows:

Objective 1: Build climate resilience and adaptive capacity to respond to climate change risk
and vulnerability.

Objective 2: Promote the integration of climate change adaptation response into
development objectives, policy, planning and implementation.

Objective 3: Improve understanding of climate change impacts and capacity to respond to
these impacts.

Objective 4: Ensure resources and systems are in place to enable implementation of climate
change responses.

3.4. Strategic Interventions
The strategic interventions of the NCCAS are presented below. Each intervention has a dedicated
Chapter to outline the envisaged actions associated with the intervention.

ntervention 1: Reduce human, economic, environmental, physical and ecological
infrastructure vulnerability and build adaptive capacity.

ntervention 2: Develop a coordinated Climate Services system that provides climate products

 4. Reduce Vulnerability and Build Adaptive Capacity

Reduce human, economic, environment, physical and ecological infrastructure vulnerability and build
adaptive capacity.

4.1. Introduction

South Africa is already experiencing the negative effects of climate change and is expected to suffer
significant consequences in the future. To promote adaptation to these impacts it is necessary to take
measures to reduce human and economic vulnerability as well as to reduce the vulnerability of
physical and ecological infrastructure to climate change. In addition, it is necessary to build the
adaptive capacity of individuals and society to respond to climate change impacts. Since vulnerability
to climate change differs depending on gender, age, wealth, social status and other factors, adaptation
actions must be targeted in ways that ensure equitable benefits for the individuals and communities
that are most vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, the contributions of vulnerable groups
should not be underestimated as their insights and capacities can help to develop actions that are
most effective. Existing strategies that focus on the inclusion of vulnerable groups should be drawn
upon, such as DEFF's gender mainstreaming strategy in the environmental sector (DEA 2016c).

Both the Paris Agreement and South Africa’s National Climate Change Response paper highlight the
importance of adopting an inclusive approach that considers vulnerable groups in climate change
response(United Nations 2015; DEA 2011a). One of the principles in South Africa’s National Climate
Change Response paper is to consider those with “special needs and circumstances” that are
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Those with special needs highlighted include “women,
and especially poor and/or rural women; children, especially infants and child headed families; the
aged; the sick; and the physically challenged” (DEA 2011a, 12). A second principle in the NCCRP that
relates to the vulnerable is “Uplifting the poor and vulnerable”. This principle relates to the need to
address the needs of vulnerable groups whilst striving for sustainability in response to climate change
(DEA 2011a). Including vulnerable groups in climate change adaptation planning, does not only mean
considering them, but also including vulnerable groups in decision-making processes, and ensuring
that they benefit from adaptation actions (NAP Global Network 2019).

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Increased resilience and adaptive capacity achieved
in human, economic, environment, physical and ecological infrastructure (Strategic Outcome 1.1).

4.2. Status Quo

South Africa has invested in understanding its climate change vulnerabilities since the late 1990s. From
as early as 1999 a set of reports on climate change vulnerability focusing on certain sectors were
developed under the programme “'South African Country Reports on Climate Change” (DEA 2018). In
the early 2000s South Africa developed a national climate change response strategy and some of the
metropolitan municipalities and provinces started to develop climate change vulnerability and
adaptation strategies. The NCCRP was then published in 2011 and following that work began on the
Long Term Adaptation Scenarios documents which provide important information on adaptation (DEA
2018). Since 2012 DEFF has been running the Lets Respond Toolkit programme, which has helped
district and local municipalities to develop climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation
strategies (DEA 2018).

24
 There are a wide range of adaptation projects that are currently being implemented in South Africa
by different stakeholders in different sectors. Some of the existing projects may not be acknowledged
as ‘climate adaptation projects’ but contribute towards building adaptive capacity and reducing
vulnerability. Similarly, the adaptation related sectors, that are identified by the NCCRP, are not the
only sectors to be affected by climate change, and actions in new emerging adaptation related sectors
are being developed in order to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

The priority “adaptation” related sectors for South Africa, as identified in the NCCRP, are water,
agriculture and commercial forestry, health, biodiversity and ecosystems, human settlements (urban,
rural and coastal), and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DEA 2011a). However, it is becoming
more apparent that these sectors are not the only ones to be affected by climate change in South
Africa. New emerging adaptation related sectors include energy, infrastructure (including transport),
tourism, mining, oceans and coast. In order to ensure that emerging sectors and adaptation actions
are considered going forward, to reduce vulnerability and build capacity, the NCCAS is adopting a
cluster approach. The clusters include:

A: Increased human resilience and adaptive capacity

B: Increased economic resilience and adaptive capacity

C: Increased environment and ecological infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity
D: Increased physical infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity

Some of the existing projects in South Africa addressing human resilience and adaptive capacity
include those that have focused on investigating the complex relationships between climate change,
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and food security. Improving health care can help to build the resilience of
communities to better be able to cope with climate change impacts (DEA 2016a). In the economic
cluster, existing projects include the investment in new technologies such as decentralised energy and
waste beneficiation. Under the environmental cluster, an effective set of projects that have been
implemented are the Working for Water, Working for Coast, and Working for Wetlands Programmes
which involve the removal of invasive alien species and protection of water resources (DEA 2017).
Under the infrastructure cluster, a range of adaptation projects are being implemented at different
spheres of government that involve climate-proofing settlements and infrastructure and developing
local early warning systems for communities.

Stakeholders that have been key implementers of climate adaptation projects include: government

actors, provincial stakeholders and municipalities, state entities, non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) and business, among others (DEA 2017).

25
 4.3. Actions
The actions to achieve this outcome are outlined below. It should be noted that this is not an
exhaustive list. There will also be interdependencies and trade-offs between these actions that will
need to be explored: In addition the actions in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the
actions in the mainstreaming chapter.

Outcome 1.1: Increased resilience and adaptive capacity achieved in human, economic,
environment, physical and ecological infrastructure

The actions have been divided up into the four clusters:

A: Increased human resilience and adaptive capacity

B: Increased economic resilience and adaptive capacity

C: Increased environment and ecological infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity
D: Increased physical infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacity

Develop a coordinated Climate Services system that provides climate products and services for key
climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas.

5.1. Introduction

South Africa experiences a wide range of weather and climate related impacts that are projected to
worsen with climate change. Some of these impacts include drought, severe storms, flooding, heat
waves, and change in the distribution of disease. These impacts pose risks to human lives, the natural
environment, infrastructure, and the economy. Different areas, natural systems, sectors, and
communities will be impacted in different ways, with some being more vulnerable than others. In
order to prepare for these impacts, it is critical that sound information and data on climate change is
available and that predictions and forecasts are disseminated so that informed and appropriate
responses and decisions can be made. The term “Climate Services” (DEA and SAWS 2016, 18) is used
to encapsulate the different information, data, forecasting and dissemination systems (DEA and SAWS
2016). The National Framework for Climate Services offers the following explanation of climate
services: “Climate services offer science based information, weather forecasts, climate predictions and
climate projections that can empower decision makers to manage the risks and opportunities of
climate variability and change” (DEA and SAWS 2016).

It is critical that climate services are put in place to provide those sectors, areas, businesses and
communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, with accurate and timely
information in order to reduce their risk and plan suitable responses. Furthermore, climate
information should be accessible for all genders and social groups, and barriers to accessing
information (e.g. literacy and access to technologies) should be considered for different groups.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Climate products and services for key climate
vulnerable sectors and geographic areas developed and implemented (Strategic Outcome 2.1).

5.2. Status Quo

There are several different stakeholders in the climate services space that provide climate information
and data, modelling and prediction services, as well as dissemination of climate related disasters.
The table below highlights some of the climate products and services that have been developed to
prepare for different types of climate impacts, including flood, drought, fire, disease, and increased
heat, as well as the stakeholders involved (DEA 2015b). It should be noted that this is not an exhaustive
list and does not include existing climate products and services in the private sector.

Recent collaborations between different weather services, emergency services and other
organisations has resulted in improved climate services, and a subsequent reduction in damage to
infrastructure and loss of life as a result of climate related disasters (DEA and SAWS 2016).

In addition, a National Framework for Climate Services has been prepared in response to the Global
Framework for Climate Services. It aims to provide a framework to better manage climate risks and
hazards by incorporating climate science and prediction services into planning, policy and practice
(DEA and SAWS 2016).

5.3. Actions

Although there are a number of climate products and services that have been implemented, there is
still room for improvement. A network to share information and learnings on climate products and
services associated technologies would also be particularly useful. It is also important to consider that
government is not the only stakeholder that should be targeted to communicate climate related
information and data, and that other stakeholders such as businesses, civil society and communities
will also benefit from accessing climate information. The following actions to improve South Africa’s
climate products and services systems are highlighted below.

5.3.1. Climate products and services for key climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas
developed and implemented

 

 

Action Description

2.1.1 Set up a National This will involve identifying a suitable institutional home for a

institution coordinate the central collation of climate data, information,

products and applications, and facilitate climate related research and
development in South Africa. Since there are a number of existing
institutions that play an important role in climate services in South
Africa and already perform some of the functions associated with the
proposed centre there is no need to establish a new institution.

climate services database and data from various climate service
providers. The platform will allow for various users to access sectoral
climate services on the site or to be directed to service providers who
can provide customised climate services or products.

 

2.1.3 Establish a Climate
Change Science Advisory
Technical Council

This will involve the establishment of an expert advisory group
consisting of climate change professionals, climate related sector
professionals, social scientist professionals from a range of fields, as
well as science and technology advisors. This group will provide
advice to the National Climate Centre.

 

2.1.4 Continue and enhance
climate observation and
monitoring networks

This will involve continued investment in and support for capturing
climate observation and monitoring data. It will also involve
identifying existing gaps in the monitoring and observation network
and addressing these gaps to ensure that national climate data is
reliable, comparable, up to date and accessible.

 

2.1.5 Continue to invest in
climate change prediction
and modelling data

This will involve the continued investment in and support for the
development of climate change predictions and modelling.

 

2.1.6 Develop and
continuously update a
national climate information
and early warning system to
address the needs to
different sectors.

This will involve developing a national climate information and early
warning system that can interface with other information systems. A
key component of the system will be methods of disseminating
information to the stakeholders in an appropriate and timely manner,
using a variety of different communication channels. It will also
involve identifying appropriate channels for vulnerable groups to
overcome the barriers they experience in accessing information

2.1.9 Improve/develop
national early warning
systems for key climate
vulnerable sectors and risks.

This will involve developing/improving early warning systems for key
sectors, such as agriculture, health, coast, and water, and risks, such
as flooding, in order to provide guidance on responding to climate
related risk. For example, agricultural early warning systems could
include warnings for crop and animal disease. Coastal warning

systems could include developing platforms that link surfing data with
real-time warnings for coastal communities. An example of a water
related early warning system could be a system that focuses on
warning of hydrological drought so that water restrictions can be
implemented in advance.

 

2.1.10 Develop and support
a climate change early
warning and vulnerability
network with the
involvement of relevant
stakeholders

This will involve setting up a climate change early warning and
vulnerability network to promote collaboration and sharing of
information on preparing for different climate related risks. Role
players should include government and research institutions, as well
as community organisations, civil society and neighbouring states.

 

2.1.11 Investigate
alternative technologies

the 4th industrial revolution

This will involve researching and investigating appropriate and
accessible alternative technologies that can be used in developing
effective and efficient climate services systems, considering new
technologies as a result of the 4th industrial revolution.

 

2.1.12 Develop adaptation
strategies for those that are
displaced by climate change.

 

This will involve assisting those displaced by climate change impacts
to plan for their futures.

 6. Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Framework

1: Develop vulnerability and resilience methodology framework that integrates biophysical and socio-
economic aspects of vulnerability and resilience.

6.1. Introduction

Sector departments need to identify and map risks and vulnerabilities that are relevant to their sectors
and to use this as a basis to develop a climate change response implementation plan. In addition,
provinces and municipalities should undertake climate change needs and response assessments based
on the vulnerabilities of the respective provinces and municipalities and use this as a basis to develop
a climate change response implementation plan.

Accordingly, there is a need to develop a framework to guide sectors, provinces and municipalities on
the process of undertaking and presenting a vulnerability assessment and the development of climate
change response implementation plans. This will assist in framing the Climate Risk and Vulnerability
Assessment process. The framework will support assessment quality and comparability by ensuring
that government sectors, provinces and municipalities as well as business and civil society take a
standard set of concepts and themes into consideration when interrogating climate risk and
vulnerability. Robust understanding thereof will assist in the process of developing appropriate
responses to climate change that will increase resilience and reduce risk.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: An adaptation vulnerability and resilience
framework developed and implemented across 100% of key adaptation sectors (Strategic Outcome
3.1).

6.2. Status Quo

Climate change vulnerability assessments and associated climate change response plans have been
developed in South Africa for a number of years by national departments, provinces, municipalities
and various entities. All the nine provinces in the country have developed risk and vulnerability
assessments. In the local sphere of government DEFF has supported all district municipalities to
develop a vulnerability assessment and a climate change response plan. Many local municipalities
have also conducted their own vulnerability assessments and developed an associated response plan.

Despite the various efforts on vulnerability and response plan development there is no agreed
vulnerability and resilience methodology framework to provide guidance to this process. As a result,
it is not always possible to compare the results of the assessments or aggregate the results in order to
provide an overall picture of vulnerability and response across sectors and spheres of government in
South Africa.

and Vulnerability
Assessment
Framework (NCRVAF)

This will involve developing an overarching adaptation and vulnerability
resilience framework that provides guidance on the development of
vulnerability assessments and climate change response plans developed by
sectors and spheres of government as well as business and civil society.
Since there is variability among sectors and geographic areas the
framework should not be prescriptive. Rather it should provide a flexible
yet structured guidance aimed at ensuring quality of assessments and
improved coherence between assessments and plans, as well as allowing
for comparisons of the results of the assessments and plans where
possible. The framework should also provide a platform to assess trade-
offs across sectors so as to further inform sector strategies and plans. The
process to develop the framework should be done in consultation with
various sectors, provinces, municipalities, research institutions and other
relevant entities. The process should also build on work that has already
been done on developing assessments and response plans.

 

3.1.2 Use the NCRVAF
to guide sector
assessments

This will involve sector departments using the NCRVAF as guidance when
undertaking initial assessments and developing response plans. Sector
departments should also use the NCRVAF as guidance when reviewing and

 7. Adaptation Planning and Mainstreaming

Strategic Intervention 4: Facilitate mainstreaming of adaptation responses into sectoral planning and
implementation.

7.1. Introduction

Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that impacts on different sectors and contexts in different ways.
Adapting to climate change therefore cannot be limited to the environmental sector and must be
integrated into planning and implementation processes in different spheres of government, sectors,
business and civil society. Developing climate change standalone strategies at different levels is
essential to provide strategic guidance on responding to climate change in South Africa. However,
these strategies need to be used as a basis to incorporate climate change adaptation into the different
national sector plans, provincial and municipal plans, and private sector strategic plans, to ensure that
it will be fully prioritised in these spheres.

The key outcomes for this strategic intervention are:
e Effective adaptation planning that covers at least 100% of the South African sectors identified
in the NCCAS (Strategic Outcome 4.1)
e Achieving 100% coverage of climate change considerations in sectoral operational plans
(Strategic Outcome 4.2)

7.2. Status Quo

All nine provinces have developed climate change response strategies that include climate adaptation
interventions. Regarding the local sphere, DEFF and the South African Local Government Association
(SALGA) facilitated the Local Government Climate Change Support Programme which resulted in the
development of climate change response plans for all the district municipalities in South Africa, with
associated adaptation interventions. Many local municipalities have also developed their own climate
change response plans using the tools from this Programme. Some provinces and municipalities are
in the process of integrating elements of their climate change response strategies into their strategic
plans. Regarding specific sectors, many of the national departments are currently developing climate
change plans for their sectors and in some cases, they are taking steps to integrate these into
departmental operational plans. In addition, some private sector businesses have developed climate
change response strategies.

 8. Research

Strategic Intervention 5: Promote research application, technology development, transfer and
adoption to support planning and implementation.

8.1. Introduction

Climate change will result in significant physical and socioeconomic effects in South Africa. It is
important that decisions made in planning for these effects are based on access to accurate and
current data and a wide range of both social science and physical science research. Investment in high-
quality climate modelling data and research on the projected impacts of climate change, among much
other research, will help reduce risk and enable the development of more effective actions. Currently
there are many institutions involved in climate related research in South Africa. However, there is a
lack of coordination between the different institutions and no central database or platform where
climate related data is shared.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Increased research output and technology uptake
to support planning and implementation (Strategic Outcome 5.1).

8.2. Status Quo

A wide range of institutions are involved in climate observation, modelling and climate-relevant
research in South Africa. These include governmental agencies like the South African Weather Services
(SAWS) and government departments such as the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI); and
academic and research institutions, such as those based at, but not limited to, the University of Cape
Town, Rhodes University, the University of the North-West, and the University of the Witwatersrand.
There are also various NGOs and community organisations that contribute to the research space in
climate adaptation.

research in South Africa, and will involve identifying areas where new and
additional research is required in South Africa, and recommending
priorities for research and development funding. Research on climate
change adaptation is not limited to climate science and will require a cross-
disciplinary approach. Research should also include social and human
sciences skills specialists, such as gender analysts, sociologists and
historians. Some potential areas to research include the relationship
between climate change and rural urban migration; adopting a regional
approach to climate change; investigating impacts of forestry on water
availability in the face of climate change; Investigating the vulnerability of
the current building stock to climate shock; research into building the
adaptive capacity of infrastructure; investigating the gendered impacts of
climate change as well as gendered vulnerabilities and capacities etc.

 9. Awareness and Capacity Building

This section presents the approach to implementing Strategic Intervention 6: Build the necessary
capacity and awareness for climate change responses.

9.1. Introduction

The importance of focusing on education in the climate change field is highlighted in the NCCRP (DEA
2011). Climate change is a challenge that will impact on multiple sectors and requires systematic
interventions in order to improve the awareness and capacity of a range of stakeholders. Despite the
advances made in South Africa since 1994, many adults, particularly women, cannot read and write,
and therefore it is crucial that these stakeholders are also considered when creating communication
and awareness programmes. Stakeholders need to understand the causes, impacts, and key
vulnerabilities associated with climate change, as well as how to respond to these vulnerabilities (DEA
2011). One of the most effective ways of improving awareness is to mainstream climate change into
different education and training curricula at different levels, such as schools and tertiary institutions.
Awareness and capacity are also particularly important in all three government spheres so that
politicians and officials are equipped to guide climate change response in their respective jurisdictions.
Since new knowledge is being generated on the impacts of climate change and appropriate responses,
awareness and capacity building is required on an ongoing basis.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Capacity building and awareness for climate change
response enhanced (Strategic Outcome 6.1).

9.2. Status Quo

There are a wide variety of stakeholders that currently provide climate change related education,
training, and awareness programmes in South Africa, including NGOs, academic institutions,
businesses and government entities. Climate change is also featured in school curricula and tertiary
level courses.

At the school level, climate change and sustainability has been included in different subjects from
grade 1-12 in the national Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS). Climate change
education materials have also been developed for teachers through the Fundisa for Change
programme. At the university level, there are a variety of climate change Honours and Master’s degree
programmes being offered at many of the universities. Furthermore, a number of different research
institutions and centres have been established in association with universities that focus on different
aspects of climate change and sustainability (DEA 2017).

In the NGO sector, there are a wide range of local and international NGOs that work in different parts
of the country in the climate change education and awareness sphere. These organisations are diverse
and work on different climate change related sectors and with different stakeholders. A number of
these NGOs work directly with the youth (DEA 2017).

In the business sector, associations, groups and forums play a role in educating business on the

possible impacts and opportunities in the sustainability and climate change field and help to promote
discussion and knowledge sharing in the private sector (DEA 2017).

45
 In the government sector, capacity and skills in the climate change field have been identified as key
challenges faced by government officials in responding to climate change (DEA 2016b). DEFF together
with SALGA developed the Let's Respond Toolkit and Local Government Climate Change Support
Programme to capacitate district and local municipality officials to understand the basics of climate
change, how to identify their climate change vulnerabilities, and how to develop response plans. This
programme adopted a hands-on approach during the workshops and developed a project website
(http://www.letsrespondtoolkit.org) where officials could access the programme materials in their
own time. All district municipalities were included in the programme and benefited from the capacity
building and training exercises.

9.3. Actions
The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:

Capacity building and awareness for climate change response enhanced

 

Action Description

 

6.1.1 Develop and This will involve developing a communication strategy that should
implement an effective |consider approaches such as: knowledge sharing events, repositories of
communication and information on climate change impacts, climate change forums, resources,
outreach programme __ |translation of climate science into actionable policies and plans. The
communication strategy should be inclusive and take into account gender,
vulnerable groups and those that cannot read and write. Furthermore the
strategy should also provide the opportunity for groups to also contribute
to the co-creation of knowledge in the field, and recognise the importance
of indigenous knowledge systems.

The communication strategy should then be launched and a continuous
communications campaign implemented. The content and target
audiences should be revised annually based on learnings and feedback.
The target audiences should prioritise the most vulnerable groups.
Government should work closely with community based organisations and
civil society organisations in the development and implementation of the
communication and outreach programme. Proposed key messaging for
the training programme can be found in Annex A.

Action

Description

 

6.1.2 Develop and
implement a training
programme for
government officials
and politicians

This will involve developing and implementing a training programme for
government officials and politicians. Since a number of training initiatives
already exist to promote the development of adaptive capacity by
government officials and politicians, such as the Let's Respond Toolkit for
municipalities, and SALGA’s training on climate change for councillors, the
programme will ensure that there is a unified approach to climate change
adaptation training and that the impacts of the programme are
monitored.

The programme can then be revised annually based on learnings and
feedback. The training programme should incorporate training to develop
the technical capacity within the various spheres of government and key
sector institutions that help build climate resilience and develop risk
response strategies.

In addition, the training programme should aim to build capacity to
mainstream climate change adaptation into planning, programmes and
new developments or projects throughout all spheres of government.

 

6.1.3 Establish formally
accredited training
courses

This will involve establishing one or more formally accredited climate
change adaptation training courses for government officials to ensure
consistency in training and to support the professional development of
participating officials. This action will be implemented by government in
partnership with other stakeholders such as research institutions.

 

6.1.4 Develop a Climate
Change Adaptation and
Environmental
Education and Training
Programme

This will involve developing a broader climate change adaptation and
environmental education training programme for implementation across
all sectors of society.

 

6.1.5 Incorporate
climate change
adaptation into
relevant, primary,
secondary and tertiary
curricula

This will involve incorporating climate change adaptation into relevant
primary, secondary and tertiary curricula to mainstream climate change
knowledge into education and training. It should form part of the broader
framework of education on sustainable development, be interdisciplinary
and aim to equip South African citizens to orient society and the economic
system towards climate resilience and sustainability. This action will be
implemented by government in partnership with research institutions.

 

6.1.6 Incorporate
climate change into
informal education and
learning

Establish reflective learning forums and committees where peer-to-peer
learning and sharing of information on climate change adaptation can be
shared informally amongst different stakeholders.

 

 

6.1.7 Enhance social
learning amongst all
levels of society.

 

This will involve enhancing social learning on climate change adaptation at
all levels and be inclusive of gender.

 10. Governance and Legislation

Strategic Intervention 7: Establish effective governance and legislative processes to integrate climate
change in development planning.

10.1. Introduction

South Africa’s international climate change commitments, the global sustainability movement, as well
as changes experienced in climate have resulted in many government sectors and departments, as
well as private organisations and communities, implementing climate change adaptation and related
projects in South Africa. Despite some coordination taking place in different spheres and sectors,
clarity around mandates, especially in the government sector, is unclear in current legislation.
Communication between different sectors is lacking and there is a risk that organisations are
conducting similar work, making use of funds that could be better spent. Adopting a more integrated
approach to climate change where roles, responsibilities and mandates are clear and where
partnerships are promoted will help to ensure that South Africa’s climate change adaptation goals are
met timeously and efficiently.

The key outcomes for this strategic intervention are:
e Adaptation governance defined and legislated through the Climate Change Act once approved
by parliament (Strategic Outcome 7.1).
e Institutional structures for climate change adaptation strengthened (Strategic Outcome 7.2).
e Enhanced public-private-civil society collaboration and stewardship (Strategic Outcome 7.3).

10.2. Status Quo

Governance

Climate change adaptation responses are currently being implemented by different spheres of
government and other sectors, such as business and research institutions. The current roles and
responsibilities for the three spheres of government and for non-government entities regarding
climate change adaptation are outlined below:

e National Government: The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF), a
UNFCCC focal point, is the lead department responsible for coordinating the implementation
of the NCCAS. Other line function national departments are responsible for integrating climate
change response into their sectors.

e Provincial Government: Each province has an environmental department that is responsible
for leading climate change response. Other line function provincial departments are
responsible for integrating climate change response into their sectors.

e Municipalities: Many critical actions required for climate change responses fall within the
responsibility of municipalities. These include the provision of basic services (water,
electricity, waste removal, and sanitation and sewage infrastructure maintenance), road
management, disaster risk management, and the provision of safe and healthy human
settlements.

e The private sector: Climate change will affect business in several ways, including through
potential changes to supply chains and direct climate risks posed to operations and assets. As
business becomes more proactive in dealing with climate risk, their insights, experiences and
resources will provide significant opportunities to leverage public sector benefits.

49
 e Civil society: Civil society plays a pivotal role in advising on and supporting adaptation
initiatives. Civil society groups are directly affected by the risks posed by a changing climate
and the opportunities created by adaptation initiatives. Civil society can raise awareness
about the need to adapt, facilitate debates, and support and monitor local implementation.

e Labour: Labour plays a pivotal role in advising on and supporting adaptation initiatives. Labour
groups are directly affected by the risks posed by a changing climate and the opportunities
created by adaptation initiatives. Labour has played a significant role in redressing past
inequities in South Africa and is an influential agent of change and transformation.

e Academia and research: Academia is central to efforts to improve the understanding of
climate science, vulnerabilities and the effects of climate change, as well as governance,
political science, policy, psychology and communication related aspects central to a holistic
climate change response, and to provide information on appropriate sectoral and community-
based responses.

e Community leadership: Community leaders are critical partners in the implementation and
awareness of climate change adaptation initiatives.

Coordinating Structures

At national level, there are several institutional structures that aim to improve coordination across
departments and alignment in national efforts. The three key national climate change adaptation
structures are:

e the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change

e the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change (IGCCC)
e the National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC)

In the provincial sphere, many of the environmental provincial departments have established
provincial climate change forums where provincial stakeholders can learn about climate change and
coordinate their climate change responses. In the local sphere DEFF’s Municipal Climate Change
Support Programme has been rolled out through established forums and working groups at municipal
level. These are important platforms on which to build capacity and strengthen responses to climate
change.

Legislation

A draft National Climate Change Bill (2018) has been developed for South Africa that outlines an
integrated approach to responding to and preparing for climate change. The bill was published in June
2018 and went through a public comment review period.

Climate Change is set up and meets on a regular basis. The Inter-
Ministerial Committee on Climate Change will aim to coordinate climate
change efforts across sector departments and spheres of government.

 

7.2.2 Continue to
facilitate the meeting
of the
Intergovernmental
Committee on Climate
Change (IGCCC)

 

 

This will involve ensuring that the IGCCC continues to meet on a regular
basis. The IGCCC fosters information exchange, consultation, agreement
and support among the spheres of government regarding climate
change and government's response to climate change. As a high-level
platform, it brings together representatives from National Treasury and
the national departments of environment, forestry and fisheries;
agriculture, land and rural development; minerals and energy; health;
human settlements, water and sanitation; international relations and
cooperation; trade and industry; transport; science and innovation;
social development; and provincial environment departments; and from
the South African Local Government Association (SALGA).

This will involve each province establishing a Provincial Committee on
Climate Change, managed by the provincial environmental departments.
This can however, be an existing forum, such as the disaster management
provincial forums, that incorporates climate change issues on the agenda.
The role of these committees is to coordinate climate change response
actions in the relevant provinces (some provinces have already
established such committees). The composition of these committees will
be determined by the provincial lead departments. Potential stakeholders
on these committees could include: Representatives from relevant
provincial departments, political representation,

society/business/academia, and representation from municipalities.

This will involve ensuring that the NCCC continues to meet on a regular
basis. The NCCC is a multistakeholder climate change forum that consists
of stakeholders from government departments, civil society, business,
and academia. The forum advises DEFF on international climate change
commitments and national climate change implementation. A wide
range of stakeholders will be consulted under the NCCC.

 

7.3.2 Implement
collaborative pilot
resilience-building
projects

 

This will involve government implementing resilience-building pilot
projects jointly with business and industry, and with civil society and
communities to demonstrate the benefits of building climate change
resilience to the private sector and communities. These pilot projects can
serve as the catalysts for future climate adaptation work in these sectors.
Lessons from existing successful resilience-building projects should also
be shared. Private-public partnerships could also be explored.

and knowledge can be shared to build climate resilience. This will
promote learning from the experiences of stakeholders in different
sectors, including NGOs, academia, business and communities to
support adaptation to climate change.

 

 

53
 11. Finance

Strategic Intervention 8: Enable substantial flows of climate change adaptation finance from various
sources.

11.1. Introduction

The projected cost range for South African adaptation response from 2020 to 2030 under the low
mitigation scenario is between R4.2 bn and R308 bn (DEA 2015a, 5). For the moderate to high
mitigation scenario the project cost range is R34 bn to R298 bn (DEA 2015a, 5). The wide-ranging
projected costs in these scenarios reflect the lack of certainty and data regarding the effects of climate
variability, which make it difficult to calculate the cost of adaptation. However, it is clear that
substantial finance will be required to implement the NCCAS in order to achieve meaningful
adaptation in South Africa.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: Adequate financial resources for national
adaptation priorities from the national fiscus and international sources (Strategic Outcome 8.1)

11.2. Status Quo

Adaptation initiatives that are spread across government departments are very often not labelled as
adaptation projects. The primary funding for adaptation activities in South Africa is through direct
allocations from the national budget via the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) including
expenditure on research programmes and activities that directly contribute to building and supporting
resilience. The other principal source of public sector finances are public intermediaries. Relevant
public intermediaries for South Africa include the Global Environment Facility (which functions as an
operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC); Development Finance Institutions (DFls)
such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the World Bank and the African
Development Bank; and Official Development Assistance Institutions and Climate Funds, for example
the Green Fund, the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund.

South Africa’s private sector has also invested in adaptation activities, including sustainable farming
practices, building ecological infrastructure and improving water infrastructure. Going forward, the
private sector will play a strategic role in both implementation and funding.

Civil society and other community groups and NGOs also play a vital role in developing and
implementing adaptation projects and programmes, especially for grassroots communities including
women.

A range of economic and financial instruments exist that are being employed by both private and
public investors to support adaptation projects. These include grants, equity, concessional and non-
concessional loans and debt, and the operational funding of private and state-owned companies.
More recently, leading private sector companies are using combinations of these instruments to
mainstream adaptation into their operational activities (for example, an energy company investing in
improving the resilience of its transmission lines to extreme weather events) or a company that

54
 develops products and services that support adaptation (such as a seed company developing drought-

resistant seeds).

11.3. Actions

The actions to achieve the outcomes associated with this intervention are outlined below:

Adequate financial resources for national adaptation priorities from national fiscus and

international sources

 

Action

Description

 

8.1.1 Carry out a cost-
benefit analysis of the
NCCAS

This will involve developing a cost-benefit analysis of the NCCAS,
initially to determine the full cost of implementing the NCCAS.
Thereafter the benefits of the NCCAS will be identified and
quantified.

 

8.1.2 Develop a gender
responsive Resource
Mobilisation Strategy

This will involve developing a resource mobilisation strategy,

through a participatory process involving different stakeholders, that
will highlight all activities involved in securing new and additional
resources for implementing the Strategy. The Resource mobilisation
strategy will also recommend ways to maximise the use of existing
resources and ensure that the most vulnerable groups are included
and that they are beneficiaries.

 

8.1.3 Develop a gender
responsive national
climate investment plan

This will involve developing a national climate investment plan,
through a participatory process involving different stakeholders,
which will provide an overview of a set of robust and financeable
adaptation projects and programmes for consideration by domestic
and international funders. The plan will ensure that the most
vulnerable groups are included and that they are beneficiaries.

 

8.1.4 Expand the list of
government entities
accredited for climate
financing

This will involve identifying additional government entities that
would be appropriate to accredit for climate financing and
supporting them through the accreditation process. The throughput
of adaptation projects to dedicated multilateral climate funds would
be maximised by expanding the list of accredited government
entities to include well-capacitated municipalities and provinces.

 

8.1.5 Build capacity of
local accredited
implementing entities to
access adaptation finance

This will involve building the capacity of accredited implementing
entities to improve their ability to secure finance. This will assist
South Africa to maximise the allocation of adaptation finance from
dedicated multilateral climate funds.

 

8.1.6 Develop a project

This will involve investigating options to include climate change
adaptation parameters in the equitable share allocations of state
revenue calculations.

 

8.1.9 Promote knowledge
exchange on the economic
benefits of public and
private sector adaptation
action

This will involve documenting public and private sector adaptation
actions and the economic benefits of these actions, and ensuring
that this information is shared widely. This will assist in promoting
the uptake of adaptation action by other public and private sector
entities.

 

8.1.10 Invest in new
gender responsive
technology and
innovation.

This will involve investing in new technologies and innovations that
can support climate change adaptation in South Africa.

 

8.1.11 Build a business
case for adaptation in
terms of national
budgeting for adaptation
and develop co-finance
mechanisms to leverage

 12. Monitoring and Evaluation

Strategic Intervention 9: Develop and implement an M&E system that tracks implementation of
adaptation actions and their effectiveness.

12.1. Introduction

Since the effects of climate change differ across geographies and will shift over time, adaptation
actions will work in some locations and time periods, and not in others. A ‘learning by doing’ approach
is therefore needed. This approach will help South Africa progressively improve the NCCAS, and as a
result, its ability to deal with the inherent uncertainty of climate change science. In order to implement
a learning by doing approach the strategic outcomes of the NCCAS must be monitored and evaluated
to understand whether progress has been made towards achieving these strategic interventions. The
results of this monitoring and evaluation can then be used to determine if any shifts are required in
terms of the strategic outcomes of the NCCAS.

The key outcome for this strategic intervention is: A national M&E system developed and implemented
(Strategic Outcome 9.1)

12.2. Status Quo

The Climate Change Adaptation Monitoring and Evaluation approach for South Africa has been
organised into Desired Adaptation Outcomes (DAOs). Nine generic DAOs have been developed, each
of which is of cross-cutting, cross-sectoral relevance and describes, in a general sense, a desired state
that will enhance South Africa’s transition towards climate resilience. These DAOs fall into two distinct
groups: six DAOs, goal 1 to goal 6, (G1-G6) describe the inputs (for example, processes, resources and
capacities) that need to be in place to enable effective climate change adaptation; and three DAOs
(G7-G9) describe the key impacts of adaptation interventions and associated measures (for example,
reductions in vulnerability of human and natural systems). These DAOs are shown in the table below.

 

Desired Adaptation Outcomes (DAOs)

 

Inputs to enable effective adaptation

 

G1 Robust/integrated policies, programmes and plans for effective delivery of climate
change adaptation, together with monitoring, evaluation and review over the short,
medium and longer-term.

 

G2 Appropriate resources (including current and past financial investments), capacity and
processes (human, legal and regulatory) and support mechanisms (institutional and
governance structures) to facilitate climate change adaptation.

 

G3 Accurate climate information (e.g. historical trend data, seasonal predictions, future
projections, and early warning of extreme weather and other climate-related events)
provided by existing and new monitoring and forecasting facilities/networks (including
their maintenance and enhancement) to inform adaptation planning and disaster risk
reduction.

G5 New and adapted technologies, knowledge, research and other cost-effective measures
(for example nature-based solutions) used in climate change adaptation.
G6 Climate change risks, impacts and vulnerabilities identified and addressed.
Impacts of adaptation interventions and associated measures
G7 Systems, infrastructure, communities and sectors less vulnerable to climate change
impacts (for example, through effectiveness of adaptation interventions/response
measures).
G8 Non-climate pressures and threats to human and natural systems reduced (particularly
where these compound climate change impacts).
G9 Secure food, water and energy supplies for all citizens (within the context of climate
change and sustainable development).

 

 

 

Clearly defined synergies exist between the NCCAS strategic outcomes and the climate change
adaptation monitoring and evaluation — and, by implication, their corresponding data/information

requirements and potential data/information outputs. This should help to ensure a robust approach

to reporting on adaptation in South Africa and monitoring the country’s journey towards climate
resilience. The relationship between the twelve NACCS strategic outcomes and the Desired Adaptation
Outcomes for climate change adaptation monitoring and evaluation is shown in the table below:

A climate change M&E system focusing on tracking

The M&E system will focus on tracking the outcomes and impact of each strategic outcome together
with the associated actions and indicators under each strategic outcome. The information/data
collected through M&E will be analysed and profiled on the Climate Change Information System. The
National Climate Change Information System (NCCIS) was recently launched and is part of the national
effort to track South Africa’s overall transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy as
required by the National Development Plan (Vision 2030) and the National Climate Change Response
Policy (2011) as well as the South Africa’s Nationally Determined Contributions (2015) to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The NCCIS offers a series of methodologies and decision support tools that can be used to apply tools
to enhance tracking, assessment and communication of the effects of climate action response policies
and actions in an accurate, consistent and, transparent manner at all scales of implementation to
inform policy and decision-making.

The information generated by the system can be used to provide insights regarding the country’s
progress in responding to climate change as implemented by a range of stakeholders and; achieving
national and international goals and targets. It further showcases necessary information for domestic
and international reporting requirements and informs positions in various negotiating platforms
nationally and internationally.

Structured pragmatic engagements, tailored made for targeted stakeholders within adaptation

landscape, will be undertaken with for capacity building on M&E. These engagements will also be used
to provide progress on M&E and will highlight challenges, gaps, opportunities and lessons learnt.

 14. Annex A: Proposed Key Messaging for Climate Change
Adaptation Communication and outreach programme

e Adapting to create a resilient South Africa has been conceptualised as the key message of
the NCCAS: This message will be central to all NCCAS related communications during both the
strategy development phase and implementation phase. In addition, there are a number of
subsidiary messages which reinforce the key message.

e South Africa needs to adapt to climate change: Sustained warming and increasing rainfall
variability over the short to medium term (the next two to three decades) will have
increasingly adverse effects on key sectors of South Africa’s economy in the absence of
effective adaptation responses.

e Climate change threatens development: The projected adverse effects of ongoing climate
change in South Africa are likely to threaten the achievement of urgent national development
needs, and well-founded aspirations to address historical inequities.

e The poor are most vulnerable to climate change impacts: The increasing frequency of
extreme weather events is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the poorest in society
(both rural and urban), amplifying existing social inequalities. The poor typically have limited
opportunities and, consequently, are disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of
climate change.

e The NCCAS will give South Africa an advantage in the future: Planning for climate change
ensures that South Africa is in a position to leverage opportunities that arise due to changing
climatic conditions and enhance its global competitiveness.

e Climate change presents investment opportunities: New funding flows to support adaptation
represent the biggest acceleration of development investment since the achievement of
democracy in South Africa. This provides a unique opportunity to both ensure climate
resilience and achieve development aspirations.

e Transformational change: Transformational, systemic change is required to address the
challenges presented by climate change.

e The need for integration and collaboration: Sectoral and integrated cross-sectoral
approaches are essential to building societal resilience in a holistic way.

e Linkages between adaptation and mitigation are increasingly vital: This is because there is
an intensified international focus on keeping global warming below 2°C, and therefore
adaptation responses need to be cognisant of their mitigation implications. At the same time,
the adverse impacts of climate change on resource availability potentially limits energy
development options. An adaptation and mitigation strategy requires integrated planning. For
instance, some forms of energy generation require large amounts of water. Since South Africa
is projected to experience drier conditions under some climate change scenarios, shortages
of water could limit energy development options.
