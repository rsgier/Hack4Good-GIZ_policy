The National Protected Area Expansion
Strategy, first published in 2008 (NPAES
2008), presents a 20-year strategy for the
expansion of protected areas in South Africa.

Provision is made for the review and updating
of the NPAES every 5 years. This document
(NPAES 2016) represents the first full revision
of the NPAES 2008, and the updated strategy
for the next 5-years (2016 — 2020). Each new
revision of the NPAES refers to a rolling 20-
year period, so this revision sets out a future
20-year strategy.

The updated NPAES 2016 now includes:

e New biodiversity data and newly declared
protected areas as well as updated
provincial conservation plans and
provincial protected area expansion
strategies (PAES), to improve the setting
of targets and the identification of priority
areas for meeting these targets.

e Areview of the performance of protected
area institutions in protected area
expansion for the first implementation
phase of the NPAES (2008 — 2014)?.

e Adescription of the priority activities,
with explicit performance targets, for the
second implementation phase (2016 —
2020) of the NPAES.

In order to maintain continuity of the NPAES
over the 20 years of the strategy, the
structure of this document has been
maintained using similar formatting to the
NPAES 2008. The document has similar
sections, but the information has been revised
and updated.

Why a National Protected Area
Expansion Strategy?

South Africa’s protected area network
currently falls far short of representing all
ecosystems and maintaining ecological
processes. In this context, the goal of the
National Protected Area Expansion Strategy
(NPAES) is to achieve cost effective protected
area expansion for improved ecosystem
representation, ecological sustainability and
resilience to climate change. The NPAES
highlights how we can become more efficient
and effective in allocating the scarce human
and financial resources available for protected
area expansion. It sets protected area targets,
maps priority areas for protected area
expansion, and makes recommendations on
mechanisms to achieve this. The common set
of targets and spatial priorities provided by
the NPAES enable co-ordination between the
many role players involved in protected area
expansion.

 Protected areas are areas of land or sea that
are protected by law and managed mainly for
biodiversity conservation. Protected areas
recognised in the National Environmental
Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of
2003) are considered protected areas in the
NPAES. The Protected Areas Act provides for
several categories of protected areas,
including special nature reserves, national
parks, nature reserves, marine protected
areas and protected environments.

Protected areas are vital for ecological
sustainability and climate change adaptation.
They also serve as nodes in our ecological
infrastructure network, protecting the
ecosystems that deliver important ecosystem
services to people. This natural infrastructure
is largely free, so is often unnoticed or under-
appreciated, but it is just as important for
underpinning human livelihoods and well-
being as our extensive built infrastructure
network and our social infrastructure. South
Africa has a unique opportunity to take a
global lead in giving protected areas a central
role in our climate change response strategy.
To achieve this, the biases of the current
protected area network are being addressed
to ensure more effective inclusion of under-
represented terrestrial ecosystems, river
ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries and marine
ecosystems in the national protected area
estate.

Protected areas are vital for ecological
sustainability and climate change
adaptation, serving as nodes in our
ecological infrastructure network. South
Africa has an opportunity to take a global
lead in giving protected areas a central role
in our climate change response strategy.

Through the protection and management that
protected areas provide for priority

ecosystems and catchments, they help to
secure the provision of important ecosystem
services, such as production of clean water,
flood moderation, prevention of erosion,
carbon storage, and the aesthetic value of the
landscape. Marine protected areas can play a
particularly important role in keeping our
fisheries sustainable, for example by
protecting nursery grounds for commercially
important fish species. In this way, protected
areas form a valuable network of ecological
infrastructure.

Protected areas can support rural livelihoods
and local economic development. Especially in
marginal agricultural areas, conservation-
related industries have higher economic
potential than agricultural activities such as
stock farming.

agricultural areas, conservation-related
industries have higher economic potential
than agricultural activities such as stock

The relationship between protected areas and
land reform has tended to be a controversial
issue, with the focus usually on land claims in
existing protected areas. Less attention has
been paid to the opportunities for protected
area expansion to actively support the land
reform agenda and the diversification of rural
livelihood options, especially in agriculturally
marginal areas. Scope exists for protected
area expansion to work in partnership with
land reform for mutual benefit, for example
through contract agreements that establish
nature reserves or other forms of biodiversity
stewardship agreement. In such cases, the
land remains in the hands of its owners rather
than being transferred to a protected area

 agency. The opportunity exists for local
communities, as potentially major landholders
through the land reform process, to have full
access to the economic opportunities
associated with ecotourism.

Scope exists for protected area expansion
to work in partnership with land reform for
mutual benefit, actively supporting the
land reform agenda and the diversification
of rural livelihoods.

Protected areas are a powerful tool for
biodiversity conservation and climate change
adaptation, but not the only one. The National
Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act
(Act 10 of 2004) gives us a suite of legal tools,
such as publishing bioregional plans and
listing threatened ecosystems, for conserving
the many biodiversity priority areas that lie
outside the protected area network. These
tools complement the expansion and effective
management of the protected area network
in pursuit of the overall goals of biodiversity
conservation and sustainable development.

Protected area targets

Protected area targets are action targets that
indicate how much of each ecosystem should
be included in protected areas. Targets help
to focus protected area expansion on the
least protected ecosystems, and provide the
basis for assessments of protection level and
progress towards a more representative
protected area network. The NPAES uses the
established biodiversity targets for each
ecosystem from the National Biodiversity
Assessment (NBA)? as the long-term
protected area targets. This ensures that
targets are scientifically robust and have an
ecological basis, such that no further
ecosystems become Critically Endangered,

3 Driver et al., 2012.

and that targets and assessment results for
the NBA and the NPAES align. The 20-year
targets for protected area expansion were
determined by proportionally allocating the
total area committed to under the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi biodiversity
targets to the individual ecosystems based on
their long-term targets. The targets are set for
individual ecosystem types.

The major improvements of this revised
NPAES 2016 are that in addition to targets for
terrestrial vegetation types and broad marine
systems, comprehensive targets have now
been set for wetlands, rivers, estuaries,
specific marine ecosystems, as well as for the
terrestrial and marine ecosystems of our
Southern Oceans and Sub-Antarctic
territories. These targets were set based ona
new integrated ecosystem map.

Comprehensive targets have now been set
for wetlands, rivers, estuaries, specific
marine ecosystems, as well as for the
terrestrial and marine ecosystems of our
Southern Oceans and Sub-Antarctic
territories

Targets can only be met by secured intact
habitat. This principle was established in the
NPAES 2008 but was previously only partially
implemented as only artificial waterbodies
were excluded. In the NPAES 2016, we have
excluded all poor condition habitats based on
a new integrated ecosystem condition map.

Targets are currently only evaluated in legally
recognised protected areas. However, once
other conservation areas are effectively
secured, verified and monitored, they may
also contribute to meeting targets.

The approach taken in the NPAES is that clear
principles and a repeatable method are

are Moderately Protected, 286 (30%) are
Poorly Protected, and 360 (37%) are Not
Protected?.

Protection level varies among regions and
biozones. Well Protected ecosystems include
the Southern Oceans and Sub-Antarctic
territories. The protected area targets for
these areas are now
fully met. Also
reasonably protected are coastal and other
shallow water systems, although key gaps
exist on the West Coast and there are too few
no-take areas. The offshore benthic and
pelagic ecosystems are almost completely
unprotected, although this should soon
change with the implementation of Operation
Phakisa®. Inland aquatic ecosystems (i.e.
rivers, wetlands and estuaries) are extremely
poorly represented in the current protected
area network, and even many areas that are
within reserves are in poor condition. Current
protection of terrestrial ecosystems is still
insufficient, though good coverage of Forest
ecosystems has been achieved. Ecosystems of

terrestrial environment, they are the same as
biomes, but the term biozone is used so that
equivalent river, wetland and marine habitat units
can be included.

the Nama-Karoo, Grasslands and Succulent
Karoo are not well represented in the current
protected area network, while lowland
Fynbos and central Savanna ecosystems are
also very under-represented.

South Africa’s current protected area network
thus falls far short of representing all

Figure 1: Protection levels for South African ecosystems

ecosystems. To meet the long-term protected
area targets we need to add 413 163km? to
the protected area network, of which

211 896km? are marine benthic and coastal
ecosystems. In addition to this, 212 140km? of
marine pelagic ecosystems needs to be
secured, though some of this could be
achieved at the same time as benthic and
coastal ecosystems as these systems overlap.

To reach these long-term targets, 20-year
targets have also been set. 255 877km? need
to be added the protected area network over
the next 20 years, of which 104 962km? are
marine benthic and coastal ecosystems. Of

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016
 the 20 year total, 146 814km? is required for
terrestrial ecosystems, 2 352km? for wetlands
and 1 490km’ for rivers. A separate

104 780km? is required to meet marine
pelagic targets though this may overlap with
some of the area required to meet the
benthic target.

Priority areas for protected area
expansion

Having set protected area targets, the next
step is to determine which geographic areas
are the highest priorities for protected area
expansion to meet those targets.

The NPAES takes the approach that the
national role is not to undertake the spatial
planning, but rather to set targets, identify
key underlying planning principles, collate the
provincial and sector priorities, and identify
any remaining gaps. The previous NPAES 2008
was forced to establish the spatial priorities
nationally as few provinces or agencies had
conservation plans and even fewer had
specific sets of protected area expansion
priorities. This has changed sufficiently to
allow a set of priority areas to be built-up
from provincial and agency plans. This is an
improvement, as detailed planning,
scheduling and operational issues are all best
dealt with at the provincial and agency level.

The revised NPAES 2016 identifies additional
priorities only where these do not exist, and
also highlights ecosystems where, if fully

 implemented, the current set of priorities will
not achieve targets. Provinces and agencies
are likely to refine, revise and adapt their
systematic spatial plans and protected area
expansion priorities over time. For this
reason, the NPAES highlights some overall
principles that should be applied in protected
area expansion planning and implementation.
The requirement for a systematic, target-
driven approach that is well integrated across
ecosystems and between organisations is
emphasised.

A comprehensive set of priority areas was
compiled based on the priorities identified by
provincial and other agencies in their
protected area expansion strategies. The
NPAES identified additional areas in the
Northern Cape where there is a recently
approved current protected area expansion
strategy. The identified priority areas cover a
total area of 190 109km/?, in addition to areas
currently under negotiation covering 73
610km? of mostly marine areas.

Overall, the set of priorities is well aligned
with requirements for improving the
representation of most ecosystems over the
next 20 years. The number of Well Protected
ecosystems is anticipated to more than
double, while Not Protected ecosystems will
reduce by around 70%. An improvement in
coverage is anticipated for 665 ecosystem
types, with greatest progress likely in the
Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna,
wetlands, rivers and offshore benthic and
pelagic ecosystems.

However, even if the priorities were to be
implemented, no improvement in protection
level is expected for 87 ecosystem types. The
main areas with ecosystems where no
improvement is anticipated are in the Nama
Karoo and arid Savanna biozones.

Mechanisms for protected area
expansion

There are three main mechanisms for
expanding the land-based protected area
network:

e Acquisition of land, the traditional way of
establishing and expanding protected
areas, which involves large upfront costs.

e Contract agreements are agreements in

Contract agreements are a key mechanism
for expanding the protected area network.
They are often much more cost effective
than acquisition of land, and are used
increasingly as part of biodiversity
stewardship programmes.

which landowners maintain ownership of
their land but enter into a contract with a
protected area agency in return for
protected area status. Provisions in the
Protected Areas Act facilitate these
agreements. Contract agreements are
attractive because they tend to cost
protected area agencies less than
acquisition, and because by far the largest
proportion of land in the priority areas for
protected area expansion lies in private
hands. Biodiversity stewardship
programmes should be strengthened so
that more use can be made of contract
agreements in the expansion of the
protected area network. There are
significant potential synergies between
biodiversity stewardship programmes,
land reform and rural development.

e Declaration of public or state land
involves reassigning land to a protected
area agency from another organ of state.
It has limited applicability because only a
small proportion of land in the priority

 areas for protected area expansion is
public land.

Each one of these mechanisms has an
important role to play, with contract
agreements being used increasingly as part of
biodiversity stewardship programmes.

Mechanisms for expanding the marine
protected area network are more complex
and require significant political negotiation
processes and the accommodation of
conflicting marine activities. Marine spatial
planning processes and subsequent
incorporation of agreed areas into marine
protected areas nevertheless have potential
to rapidly improve the representation of
marine ecosystems when the process is
successfully undertaken. South Africa’s
Operation Phakisa is proving to be
international best practice in this regard.

Mechanisms for securing protected areas
specifically focused on inland aquatic
ecosystems remain poorly understood. The
current process of securing rivers, wetlands
and estuaries using the methods used for
terrestrial ecosystems has proved largely
ineffective. Even when the features are fully
incorporated into protected areas, they are
still subject to catchment related impacts.
Much work remains to understand how to
properly secure inland aquatic ecosystems
and their associated processes.

Implementation of the NPAES

The primary implementers of the NPAES are
protected area agencies and institutions.
These include provincial conservation
authorities; South African National Parks
(SANParks); the Department of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); and the Oceans
and Coasts Branch of the Department of
Environmental Affairs (DEA). Although most
agencies have developed institution-specific
protected area expansion plans, those that
have not need to rapidly do so. Existing plans
will require revision and greater alignment
with the national strategy, which has been
revised for the second phase of the NPAES.

DEA (through Working Group 1 of MINMEC)
will ensure alignment of the efforts of the
multiple agencies involved in protected area
expansion. It will also provide a forum for
discussing challenges and sharing lessons, and
track progress towards meeting protected
area targets. Establishing and strengthening
provincial biodiversity stewardship
programmes is an institutional priority for
provincial conservation authorities and for
DEA.

The NPAES 2016 provides a revised set of
implementation targets for phase 2 (2016 —
2020), developed with consideration of the
realistic resources available to implementing
agencies.

Financing protected area expansion

Protected area expansion draws on several
sources of finance, all of which have an
important role to play given the size of the
task of achieving protected area targets.
These sources include funding from National
Treasury and donors (particularly for land
acquisition); revenues earned from protected
areas; biodiversity-related fiscal reform to
facilitate investment and expenditure by

biodiversity offsets could potentially
support the expansion of the protected
area network. Priority areas for protected
area expansion should be the major
receiving sites for offsets.

private landowners through contract
agreements; and strategic implementation of
the biodiversity offsets programme.

The purchase of land for protected area
expansion could arguably be a good national
investment in climate change adaptation, but
in reality, the cost is prohibitive for protected
area agencies. For this reason, this strategy
highlights the importance of expansion
mechanisms other than land acquisition,
particularly contract agreements through the
biodiversity stewardship programmes.

Fiscal incentives contained in the Revenue
Laws Amendment Act (Act 60 of 2008), have
the potential to stimulate protected area
expansion by making defined conservation
management costs and land costs tax
deductible for landowners who have entered
into specified contractual agreements.
Additional biodiversity-related fiscal reform
options being explored include reducing the
transaction costs associated with land
acquisition for protected areas, removing
perverse incentives in municipal property
rates, and using Expanded Public Works
Programme funding as an incentive to
encourage landowners to enter into contract
agreements.

The strategic and efficient use of biodiversity
offsets could potentially support the
expansion of the protected area network.
Priority areas for protected area expansion
should be the major receiving sites for offsets,
rather than ad hoc and individually identified
sites. Careful planning will be necessary to

ensure that offsets contribute optimally to
protected area expansion and management,
and do not place an undue burden on
protected area agencies. A key issue is
securing ongoing management costs.

Innovative financial mechanisms for protected
area expansion that could be piloted include a
conservation trust fund, and payments for
ecosystem services in cases where protected
areas contribute to, for example, catchment
management and water supply.

Information gaps and research
priorities

A number of information gaps identified in

the first phase of the NPAES were filled in this
revision. There remain further gaps that
should be addressed in future revisions of the
NPAES. These include an accurate and up-to-
date mapping of protected areas anda
national spatial data layer on land ownership
and tenure.

Research priorities include further exploration
of the role of protected areas in supporting
ecosystem-based adaptation to climate
change. Ecologically meaningful biodiversity
targets for aquatic ecosystems need to be
developed. Exploration of innovative ways to
consider land price and opportunity costs in
the identification of priority areas for
protected area expansion are needed, as well
as investigation of the likely costs of different
mechanisms for protected area expansion
into the future. Also useful would be
additional research into the relative income
and job creation potential of agriculture
compared with protected areas and
ecotourism. Finally, pilot projects are needed
to evaluate the ways in which biodiversity
stewardship agreements can used to support
land reform and rural development.

 1. Why a National Protected Area Expansion Strategy?

The goal of the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy (NPAES) is to achieve cost effective
protected area expansion for improved ecosystem representation, ecological sustainability and
resilience to climate change. It sets protected area targets, maps priority areas for protected area
expansion, and makes recommendations on mechanisms to achieve this. This is particularly
important in the context of South Africa’s globally exceptional biodiversity richness on the one hand,
and significant financial and human resource constraints on the other.

The NPAES is a 20-year strategy with 5-year implementation targets aligned with a 5-year revision
cycle. Each new revision of the NPAES refers to a rolling 20-year period, so this revision sets out a
future 20-year strategy. The NPAES 2016 reviews the first phase of the NPAES (2008 — 2014) and
provides the strategy and implementation plan for the second phase (2016 — 2020).

This chapter outlines the importance of the NPAES in enabling co-ordination among many role-
players towards more efficiently and effectively allocating the limited resources available for
protected area expansion. It also sets out the scope of the NPAES and the structure of this strategy.

South Africa’s protected area network

remains insufficient to conserve biodiversity
and ecological processes effectively, or to play
its full potential role in providing resilience to
the impacts of climate change. This is because
of the ad hoc way the protected area network
has developed over time, protecting some
ecosystems well and others hardly at all.
Historically, freshwater, estuarine and
offshore marine ecosystems were especially
poorly represented in the protected area
network although significant steps have been
taken recently to improve this situation.

South Africa’s current protected area
network in both the terrestrial and the
marine environments remains insufficient
to conserve biodiversity and ecological
processes effectively, or to play its full
potential role in providing resilience to the
impacts of climate change.

The overall goal of the NPAES is to achieve
cost effective protected area expansion for
improved ecosystem representation,

ecological sustainability and climate change
adaptation. The NPAES highlights how we can
become more efficient and effective in
allocating limited resources available for
protected area expansion. It sets protected
area targets, maps priority areas for protected
area expansion, and makes recommendations
on mechanisms to achieve this.

While the primary roles of the protected area
network are representation of all ecosystems,
ecological sustainability and climate change
resilience, protected areas also deliver
significant socio-economic benefits, especially
in rural areas, thus contributing to South
Africa’s overall development goals.

Many role players, public and private, are
involved in creating, expanding and managing
protected areas in South Africa. The NPAES
provides a common set of targets and spatial
priorities to guide efforts and enable co-
ordination. This is particularly important in
the context of South Africa’s globally
exceptional biodiversity richness on the one
hand, and significant financial and human
resource constraints on the other.

 While the primary roles of the protected
area network are representation of all
ecosystems, ecological sustainability and
climate change resilience, protected areas
also deliver significant socio-economic
benefits, especially in rural areas, thus
contributing to South Africa’s overall
development goals.

The Department of Environmental Affairs
(DEA) led the development of the NPAES, in
consultation with the protected area agencies
and other key stakeholders. The need for the
development of the NPAES was established in
the National Biodiversity Framework’. The
NPAES is a 20-year strategy with 5-year
implementation targets aligned with a 5-year
revision cycle. Each new revision of the NPAES
refers to a rolling 20-year period. The NPAES
2016 covers the implementation period 2016-
2020 and sets out a future 20-year strategy.

The NPAES does not deal with site-scale
planning or exactly which sites should be
included in the protected area network, nor
does it deal with detailed implementation
planning for expanding protected areas. All of
these are most appropriately done by
protected area agencies and institutions,
using the NPAES as a guide.

Expansion of the protected area network
should take place concurrently with efforts to
improve biodiversity management
effectiveness within existing and new
protected areas. This need is not addressed in
the NPAES, but requires attention alongside
the implementation of the NPAES, particularly
in some provincial protected area agencies as
well as in the marine protected areas.

The NPAES is intended to be used by all those
who play, or could play, a role in protected
area expansion, including protected area
institutions, agencies and managers,
conservation non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) and funding agencies, policymakers in
relevant national departments, municipalities
and the private sector.

 2. The role of protected areas

Protected areas are vital for ecological sustainability and climate change adaptation, serving as
nodes in our ecological infrastructure network. South Africa has a strong legal context for protected
areas and management of biodiversity. This chapter explains the role of protected areas in
biodiversity conservation and ecological sustainability, in addition to the role they play in climate
change adaptation, land reform and rural livelihoods, and socio-economic development. South
Africa has an opportunity to be proactive in giving protected areas a central role in our climate
change response strategy. To achieve this, the biases of the current protected area network are
being addressed to ensure more effective inclusion of under-represented terrestrial ecosystems,
river ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries and marine ecosystems in the national protected area estate.

Protected areas are vital nodes in South
Africa’s ecological infrastructure. Our
ecological infrastructure consists of nodes and
corridors of natural habitat that provide a
range of ecosystem services as well as
resilience to the impacts of climate change
and natural disasters. This natural
infrastructure is largely free, so is often
unnoticed or under-appreciated, but it is just
as important for underpinning human
livelihoods and wellbeing as our extensive
built infrastructure network and our social
infrastructure.

Protected areas are vital nodes in South
Africa’s ecological infrastructure. They help
to ensure functional landscapes that
provide stable environments for the benefit
of human well-being.

In this chapter, we highlight four of the most
important contributions of protected areas,
some of them only partially realised and all
worthy of further attention:

e Biodiversity conservation and ecological
sustainability

e Climate change adaptation

e Land reform and rural livelihoods

e Socio-economic development, including
ecosystem services

Transfrontier conservation areas, of which
there are six shared between South Africa and
our neighbouring countries, provide
opportunities for scaling up all of the above
contributions of protected areas and for
strengthening the links between ecological
sustainability benefits and socio-economic
benefits.

What are protected areas?

Protected areas are areas of land or sea that
are formally protected by law and managed
mainly for biodiversity conservation. Only
protected areas recognised in the National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas
Act (Act 57 of 2003) are considered to be
protected areas in the NPAES.

The Protected Areas Act distinguishes

between several categories of protected area:
special nature reserves, national parks, nature
reserves, marine protected areas and
protected environments. In addition, it also
recognises world heritage sites, specially
protected forest areas, and mountain
catchment areas.

The NPAES uses a narrower definition of
protected areas than the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) and IUCN, which
acknowledge the role of other effective area-

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016
 based conservation measures in protecting
biodiversity. These areas could include
conservation areas that are areas of land not
formally protected by law but informally
protected by the current owners and users
and managed at least partly for biodiversity
conservation. They can also include a range of
other mechanisms such as the intact and
conservation zoned areas of UNESCO
biospheres, buffers zones on world heritage
sites, areas protected by spatial planning laws
(e.g. zoning for conservation use), areas
protected by conservation servitudes, and in
the marine context may include specially
zoned fishery management areas.

In the absence of legally binding measures
that require effective management, these
other area-based conservation measures may
not provide sufficient protection. For this
reason, the NPAES currently only evaluates
protected areas. However, once other area-
based conservation sites have been effectively
secured (through legal measures other than
the Protected Areas Act), are effectively
managed, verified and monitored, then it is
anticipated that intact conservation zoned
areas under these other measures might also
contribute to meeting targets.

The legal context

The Protected Areas Act is the central piece of
legislation for the establishment and
management of the protected area network
in both the terrestrial and the marine
environments. However, other legislation is
also relevant, including the World Heritage
Convention Act (Act 49 of 1999) for world
heritage sites, the National Forests Act (Act 84
of 1998) for protected forests, and the
Mountain Catchment Areas Act (Act 63 of
1970). In addition, several provinces have
their own provincial legislation that deals with
protected areas.

The Protected Areas Act is the central piece

of legislation for the establishment and
management of the protected area

network in both the terrestrial and marine

environments.

Protected areas are a powerful tool for
conserving biodiversity and adapting to
climate change, but not the only one. There
are also several other legislative tools relevant
to the management of biodiversity in South
Africa, the primary among them being the
National Environmental Management:
Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004). The
Biodiversity Act provides a suite of legal tools
for conserving the many biodiversity priority
areas that lie outside the protected area
network and for various reasons are likely to
remain outside of it. These tools include
bioregional plans, biodiversity management
plans, listing of threatened or protected
ecosystems, listing of threatened or protected
species, and regulations on alien and invasive
species. In addition to regulatory tools
provided by the Biodiversity Act, economic
mechanisms such as environmental fiscal
reform and payment for ecosystem services
are currently being explored and developed in
South Africa.

The Marine Living Resources Act (Act 18 of
1998) provides for additional mechanisms for
biodiversity management over and above
marine protected areas, and South Africa is in
the process of implementing the ecosystem
approach to fisheries management.

This wide range of biodiversity management
tools complements the expansion and
effective management of the protected area
network in pursuit of the overall goals of
biodiversity conservation and sustainable
development.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016
 Protected areas for biodiversity
conservation and ecological
sustainability

Protected areas are the most secure and
effective mechanism for conserving a
representative sample of all biodiversity
including all ecosystems and species. This is
especially important in South Africa because
of our globally exceptional levels of
biodiversity. Conserving a viable
representative sample of biodiversity
contributes to ecological resilience and is one
of the cornerstones of ecological
sustainability.

Historically, the protected area network has
been biased towards some ecosystems, such
as indigenous Forest, mountain Fynbos and
lowveld Savanna, and has poorly covered
other ecosystems such as Grasslands. Aquatic
ecosystems, including rivers, wetlands,
estuaries and offshore marine ecosystems,
have been especially neglected. South Africa’s
protected area network needs to include a
representative sample of all ecosystems. How
this can be achieved is discussed further in
Chapter 4 on protected area targets.

The long-term persistence of biodiversity
depends not only on conserving a
representative sample of biodiversity but also
on maintaining a complex set of ecological
processes, such as the functioning of river
corridors and movement of species between
uplands and lowlands. Ecological processes

 

 

often occur across very large areas and over
long periods of time, so they can be difficult
to capture in the protected area network.
Nevertheless, it is possible to take some
ecological processes into account in the
design of the protected area network.

 

For protected areas to achieve their full
potential contribution to ecological
sustainability, they need to include a
representative sample of all ecosystems as
well as key ecological processes. In
recognition of this, the NPAES 2016 includes
greater integration of the terrestrial and
aquatic environments in the design
calculations underpinning the spatial
prioritisation of protected area expansion.
This is especially important in South Africa
where water scarcity means that freshwater
ecosystems are under even greater pressure
than terrestrial ecosystems.

Estuaries can provide a focal point for
integrating the design of terrestrial,
freshwater and marine protected areas.
Ideally, seamless integration is required
between terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine,
inshore and offshore marine protected areas,
to maximise the ecological sustainability
benefits of protected areas.

 Protected areas for climate change
adaptation

Healthy natural ecosystems can increase
resilience to the impacts of climate change, by
allowing species to adapt as naturally as
possible to the changes. They also buffer
human settlements and activities from the
impacts of extreme climate events.

A sufficient protected area network supports
the persistence of biodiversity within the
broader landscape and safeguards the long-
term provision of ecosystem goods and
services (such as sufficient clean water,
pollination etc.) on which we all depend,
especially in the face of stresses such as
climate change. Intact ecosystems (i.e.
ecosystems which are in a natural or near-
natural state) withstand stresses better than
highly modified and fragmented landscapes,
and natural landscapes secured within
protected areas are the anchor on which
survival of broader ecological systems will
depend. This role of protected areas is worthy
of greater emphasis in the global debate on
climate change adaptation. South Africa has a
unique opportunity to take a global lead in
giving protected areas a central role in our
climate change response strategy.

Healthy natural ecosystems can increase
resilience to the impacts of climate change,
by allowing ecosystems and species to
adapt as naturally as possible to the
changes and by buffering human
settlements and activities from the impacts
of extreme climate events. South Africa has
an opportunity to take a global lead in
giving protected areas a central role in our
climate change response strategy.

An implication of this is that protected area
expansion should prioritise protection of
natural connected landscapes. Protected
areas need to be expanded to incorporate
altitudinal gradients and topographic range,
intact river corridors, coastal dunes, and a
greater range of microhabitats, in order to
conserve the climatic gradients required to
give us some leeway for climate change. The
ability of species and systems to adapt to
climate change will depend on landscapes
that are sufficiently connected to allow
species to move.

Freshwater ecosystems are likely to be
particularly hard hit by rising temperatures
and shifting rainfall patterns, and yet healthy,
intact freshwater ecosystems are vital for
maintaining resilience to climate change and
mitigating its impact on human well-being. In
the western part of South Africa, which is
likely to become dryer, intact rivers and
wetlands will help to maintain a consistent
supply of water. In portions of the country
that are likely to become wetter, intact rivers
and wetlands will be important for reducing
flood risk and mitigating the impacts of flash
floods. This reinforces the importance of
including freshwater ecosystems in land-
based protected areas, and moving towards
integrated aquatic and terrestrial design of
the protected area network.

Protected areas for land reform and
rural livelihoods

Historically, local communities have often
been only minor recipients of benefits
generated by protected areas, as in most
cases they have not been owners of either the
protected area land or the tourist facilities on
that land. The opportunity now exists for local
communities, as potentially major landholders
through the land reform process, to have full
access to the economic opportunities

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016
 associated with ecotourism. Two good
examples of this are Nambiti Private Game
Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal and the !Ae!Hai
Kalahari Heritage Park together with the !Xaus
Lodge within the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.

Scope exists for protected area expansion to
work in partnership with land reform for
mutual benefit, actively supporting the land
reform agenda and the diversification of rural
livelihoods.

Contract agreements are used increasingly in
expansion of the protected area network, and
represent opportunities for mutual benefit
between landowners, who receive incentives
and assistance with management, and
protected area agencies. It is important to
note that biodiversity stewardship
programmes allow for considerable flexibility
in the nature of agreements concluded. For
example, it is possible for part of the land
involved to be formally proclaimed a
protected area, and part not. The Richtersveld
National Park, the Makuleke section of Kruger
National Park and iSimangaliso Wetland Park
provide good examples of community
ownership of formal protected areas through
contract agreements.

As discussed in the next section on socio-
economic development, protected areas
often represent the most promising option for
economic development in rural regions,
providing more jobs than commercial
agriculture would.

Biodiversity stewardship programmes have
now been developed, and are under

implementation, in all nine provinces of the
country, with the potential to contribute to
land reform.

Protected areas for socio-economic
development

Protected areas are important for socio-
economic development in several ways. They
can contribute to rural development and local
economic development with immediate
benefits to surrounding communities.
Protected areas also contribute to the
attractiveness of South Africa as a key
destination for foreign and national tourists.
By providing essential ecosystem services,
protected areas safeguard the wellbeing of
future generations.

Protected areas can be a cornerstone for local
economic development, providing immediate
socio-economic benefits to surrounding
communities, especially if this is an explicit
aspect of the management goals of the
protected area. Increasingly, there is
sensitivity in the design and management of
protected areas to the needs of local and
regional communities, with protected areas
seen not as isolated islands but as part of the
socio-economic, as well as the ecological,
environment. The DEA’s People and Parks
programme is significant in this regard.

Protected areas can be a cornerstone for
local economic development, providing
immediate socio-economic benefits to
surrounding communities

In many rural regions, ecotourism based on
protected areas provides a more viable option
for economic development and livelihoods
than agriculture, even though agriculture is
currently often the main focus for rural socio-
economic development. As mentioned in the
previous section, land reform provides the

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016
 opportunity for communities to become
landholders in protected areas and to benefit
directly from ownership of ecotourism
ventures.

Especially in marginal agricultural areas,
evidence suggests that conservation-related
industries (protected areas, ecotourism on
private reserves, game farming etc.) may have
higher economic potential than agricultural
activities such as stock farming. Further
research and support for pilot initiatives is
required to test this evidence formally and to
determine whether these economic trends
can be generalised across South Africa.

The protected area network forms part of
South Africa’s competitive advantage as a
nation, creating destinations for nature-based
tourism, providing a draw card for
international interest and attention, and
acting as a unique selling point for Brand
South Africa. Our national identity includes
the spectacular varied natural environment
that is secured through our protected area
network.

Through the protection and management
they provide for priority ecosystems and
catchments, protected areas help to secure
the ecological infrastructure which supports

the provision of important ecosystem
services, such as production of clean water,
flood moderation, prevention of erosion,
carbon storage, and the aesthetic value of the
landscape. Mountain catchment areas, in
particular, play an important role in
safeguarding water supplies.

Marine protected areas are vital in sustaining
commercial, recreational and subsistence
fisheries resources. There is increasing
evidence globally that the vast majority of fish
stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.
Fishing pressure continues to threaten marine
ecosystems and the cultures and economies
that depend on them. Marine protected areas
can help to address this by protecting
spawning (breeding) stocks of fish species and
allowing recovery of overexploited fish
species. This results in improved fishing yields
outside of marine protected areas through a
spillover effect. Often marine protected areas
are the only areas in which viable numbers of
reproductive fish are found. It is worth noting
that no-take marine protected areas or no-
take zones within marine protected areas, of
which there are few in South Africa, play this
role most effectively.

Finally, by contributing to climate change
adaptation and protecting aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems and the services they
provide, the protected area network
safeguards the socio-economic well-being of
future generations. The costs to future
generations of not building and maintaining
an effective protected area network are
complex to quantify, but we can be sure they
are substantial.

 3. Progress in implementing the NPAES

Measureable progress across a range of indicators was made in implementing the first phase of the
NPAES. This chapter highlights the new protected areas that were declared in both the marine and
the terrestrial environments, which increased the spatial extent of a range of protected area types.
Particularly notable were the expansion efforts in the marine environment, as well as expansion
achieved as part of the biodiversity stewardship programme. Progress towards achieving specific
ecosystem targets is presented. This chapter also provides a summary of improvements in
administering the NPAES and the resources used to do so.

achieved through the declaration of three

Progress towards achieving
protected area targets

The progress in achieving phase 1
representation targets® for terrestrial
ecosystem types in the protected area system
is summarised in Table 2. When individual
ecosystems are considered, the area
contributing to meeting ecosystem targets
improved from 3.6% to 3.9% of the total
terrestrial area. This represents 18% of the
phase 1 target. Biozones where good progress
was made towards meeting underlying
ecosystem representation targets in phase 1
include Forests (129% of the phase 1 target),
water bodies (91%) and Albany Thicket (69%).
No progress was made however in the Desert

limited progress was made in the Nama-Karoo
(9%), Savanna (14%) and Grassland (16%).

In the marine environment, the declaration of
a single MPA in the Prince Edward Island
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) resulted in this
area substantially exceeding the phase 1
target. In fact, the long-term target was
exceeded by a factor of almost two and the
no-take target nearly met (Table 3). In
mainland marine systems, two inshore MPAs
(278km?) were declared. As a result, the 5-
year NPAES inshore target measured in terms
of coast length for no-take areas was almost
met, with 89% of the phase 1 target being
achieved, while 163% of the phase 1 target for

but are not formally declared. Formalising their
status is critical to ensuring that they continue to
contribute to the protected area network.

 overall inshore protection was met. This
placed South Africa in a good position to
achieve the full 20-year Marine Inshore
targets. Little progress was made towards

achieving the marine offshore area targets
with the 278km? being under 1% of the
phase 1 target of 52 182 km’.

 The negotiations and conclusion of
contractual agreements with landowners
was the predominant mechanism for
protected area expansion in phase 1.

Mechanisms of expansion

All three available protected area expansion
mechanisms for terrestrial protected areas
(contractual agreement, land acquisition and
declaration of state owned land) were
successfully implemented in phase 1. The
breakdown of the extent of the area declared,
by implementing agency, using each of the
different expansion mechanisms is
summarised in Table 4 below. The negotiation
and conclusion of contractual agreements
with landowners was the predominant
protected area expansion mechanism
adopted by most of the protected area
agencies. During the phase 1 review,
protected area institutions reported that a

further 1 100 000ha was still under some form
of contractual negotiation with landowners
for future declaration as protected areas.

Implementation, resourcing and
administration of the NPAES

The implementation of the NPAES is primarily
the responsibility of the 12 protected area
agencies". By the end of phase 1, eight (up
from only one in 2008) of the 12 protected
area agencies had developed, adopted and
were implementing an institutionally-based
Protected Area Expansion Strategy (PAES) that
is closely aligned to the strategic objectives of
the NPAES. The remaining agencies — with the
exception of DAFF, which has no plans to
develop an institutionally-based PAES — were
well advanced in preparing these strategies.

Expansion plans for the marine environment
are well developed, and were recently
published as part of Operation Phakisa’.

 The institutional capacity to implement the
protected area expansion programme is
limited, with an estimated total of 28 staff
(that are unevenly distributed between
institutions) contributing more than 60% of
their time to protected area expansion.

The reported annual operational budgets for
protected area expansion are also highly
variable across institutions. It is estimated
that a total of R61.75 million was available for
protected area expansion efforts during the
2014/2015 financial year. Of this total
amount, R34.5 million forms part of the South
African National Parks (SANParks) budget and
R12 million is set aside for marine protected
area expansion, leaving approximately R15
million distributed across the remaining ten
protected area institutions.

Phase 1 of the NPAES saw a number of legal
and administrative developments that
advanced protected area expansion. In this
regard it is noted that:

e The Protected Areas Act was amended to
include marine protected areas.

3 DEA., 2009

e The process of developing standardised
Biodiversity Stewardship Guidelines*? and
a national Biodiversity Stewardship Policy
was significantly advanced.

e Incentives for declaring privately owned
and managed protected areas through tax
rebates were piloted and further refined

e Levels of legislative compliance were
improved through the development of the
Protected Area Register.

e The development of a robust, spatial
protected area database, linked to the
Protected Area Register.

e Guidelines for the declaration of different
types of protected areas were published.

Phase 1 of the NPAES saw a number of

legal and administrative developments that

have advanced protected area expansion.

made in phase 1 of the NPAES is given in

 4. Protected area targets

Protected area targets are action targets that indicate how much of each ecosystem should be
included in protected areas. They help to focus protected area expansion on the least protected
ecosystems, and provide the basis for assessments. The NPAES uses the established biodiversity
targets for each ecosystem from the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) as the long-term
protected area targets. This ensures that targets are scientifically robust and have an ecological
basis, while also ensuring that no further ecosystems become Critically Endangered, and that the
NBA and the NPAES are aligned. The 20-year targets are designed to achieve overall CBD Aichi
biodiversity targets, while optimally shifting the emphasis onto high biodiversity value ecosystems.
Clear principles and a repeatable method are established for target setting, which will enable easy

updates and allow provinces and agencies to calculate compatible targets.

This chapter presents several major improvements that have been made to the protected area
targets in this revision of the NPAES. These include comprehensive targets for wetlands, rivers,
estuaries and specific marine ecosystems, as well as terrestrial ecosystem types. A new integrated
ecosystem map has been created and ecological condition has been included in the assessment.

South Africa’s current protected area network still falls far short of sustaining biodiversity and
ecological processes. The current achievement of targets has been evaluated, protection levels are
mapped and the extent to which the current protected area network falls short of the targets is

presented.

Protected area targets are action targets that
indicate how much of each ecosystem should
be included in protected areas, thus guiding
protected area expansion to focus on
ecosystems that are least protected.“

Protected area targets are action targets
that indicate how much of each ecosystem
should be included in protected areas, this
guiding protected area expansion to focus

Internationally, the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD) to which South Africa is a
signatory, commits governments to a range of
targets generally known as Aichi biodiversity

can be found in Technical Note 1 of Appendix 2.
15 CBD, 2010.

16 Biodiversity targets are sometimes called
biodiversity thresholds. See Driver et al., 2012 for

targets’. Target 11 states that “by 2020, at
least 17% of terrestrial and inland water
areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas,
especially areas of particular importance for
biodiversity and ecosystem services, are
conserved through effectively and equitably
managed, ecologically representative and well
connected systems of protected areas and
other effective area-based conservation
measures, and integrated into the wider
landscape and seascape”.

South Africa has a well-established system of
systematic biodiversity planning which uses
biodiversity targets’® to determine which
areas of the landscape and seascape are most

 important for conserving a representative
sample of biodiversity pattern (ecosystems
and species) and for keeping key ecological
processes intact. These targets are used as the
basis for national monitoring of Protection
Level in the NBA.

The system and target values set out in the
NBA 2011 are widely used and well-accepted
across South Africa, including in the National
Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas
Assessment (NFEPA) project?’, prioritisation
for marine protected areas in projects such as
the Offshore Marine Protected Area (OMPA)
project?®, and the National Estuary
Biodiversity Plan for South Africa 20127°. The
same ecosystem targets are used in provincial
conservation plans. Biodiversity targets for
terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa range
from 16% to 36% of the original extent of
each ecosystem, with higher targets for more
variable and species-rich ecosystems. In the
absence of better data, a 20% biodiversity
target is used for marine, river, wetland and
estuarine systems.

The NPAES 2016 retains many core principles
established for the NPAES 2008, including:

e Long-term protected area targets should
align with established biodiversity targets.
This means that, in principle, enough of
each ecosystem will be protected to
ensure that no further ecosystems can
become Critically Endangered. It also
allows for consistent reporting by the NBA
and NPAES.

e Targets should be specifically set for each
ecosystem. Although for convenience
they can be reported for broader units

18 Sink et al., 2011.

19 Turpie et al., 2012.

20 The CBD targets have changed since NPAES 2008
(from 12%) to 17% for terrestrial areas and 10%
for marine systems.

such as a biozone, the actual target is set
at the ecosystem level.

e Over a 20-year period, South Africa should
aim to achieve its commitments under the
CBD” even if the convention’s timelines
are not adhered to.

e The allocation of targets is optimised
across ecosystems to reflect differing
levels of biodiversity, i.e. increased targets
for diverse ecosystems, but reduced
targets in those with relatively low
diversity, so that overall South Africa will
achieve its CBD commitment.

Some additional elements have been added in
the NPAES 2016. Firstly, and most
importantly, targets have now been set for
marine, wetland, river and estuarine features
at the ecosystem level, in addition to the
terrestrial targets. To do this, a new fully
integrated ecosystem map was prepared,
covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine,
coastal and marine ecosystems (Figure 4)*1.
Separate maps for each of these ecosystems
were available, but overlaps between
ecosystems (for example a terrestrial and
river ecosystem) could result in double
counting and inaccurate targets. A single

ecosystem map can be found in Technical Note 3
of Appendix 2.

Islands and offshore pelagic ecosystems.

The second addition in the NPAES 2016 is that
targets can only be met in intact habitat. This
principle was established in the NPAES 2008
but was only partially implemented as only
artificial waterbodies were excluded at that
time. The underlying principle is that areas
that are no longer intact (e.g. large dams,
roads, rest camps, canalised sections of rivers
and plantations of exotic trees) should not
contribute to targets even if they are in
protected areas. Hence, the preparation of a
fully integrated ecosystem condition map was
a key activity for the NPAES. This process
produced the first ever integrated map of
ecosystem condition for South Africa, which
identified good, fair and poor condition areas
of each ecosystem (Figure 5)?3.

other areas with effective area-based
conservation measures. Currently, we only
evaluate protected areas, as these are the
only areas where biodiversity is currently
legally secured. In the future, once other area-
based conservation mechanisms have been
secured effectively (e.g. through having intact
natural areas of biospheres strictly zoned for
conservation), subject to robust and effective
land use controls, and have well-capacitated
management authorities, it is anticipated that

Calculating protected area targets

The NPAES has established a system that sets
robust targets, but which can be quickly and
easily updated when changes in any of the
input elements occur“. In brief, the
biodiversity targets for each ecosystem are
identified from the NBA, and these are used
as the long-term protected area targets. To
calculate the 20-year targets, the ratio
between the total area required to meet
South Africa’s CBD commitments and the total
area needed to meet the long-term protected
area target is then calculated’>. This ratio is
used to identify what proportion of the long-

are 50% of the long-term biodiversity targets,
while those for terrestrial ecosystems are
78.63%. Shorter term protected area targets
(e.g. 5-year target) are calculated as a portion
of the 20-year target.

The target setting approach outlined here was
applied using the integrated ecosystem map
specially created for this strategy, which
produced the values reflected in the tables,
analyses and appendices of this report, but
the same approach can be applied to any
other ecosystem map. This allows provinces
to use finer scale local ecosystem maps for
their target setting and planning processes,

25 This was calculated separately for terrestrial and
marine systems. Coastal ecosystems, which have a
land component, were treated as terrestrial.

 while remaining fully compatible with the
NPAES approach and required overall target.

26 78.63% of the biodiversity target for terrestrial
ecosystems and 50% for marine ecosystems

27 At least 75% of the Marine Protected Area
network should be designated no-take areas.

Summary of protected area targets

The final target percentages for the NPAES
2016 are summarized in Table 5. Importantly,
the underlying targets are set at the
ecosystem level, which are given in detail in
Appendix 1. The long-term protected area
targets, which are the same as the
biodiversity targets, range from 16% to 36% of
original extent. The 20-year protected area
targets range from 10% to 28.3%, with many
systems such as coastal types, wetlands,
estuaries and rivers having a target of 15.7%.

Table 6 summarizes the total areas required
to meet the targets. A total of 574 735km/%, of
which 363 392km? is the 20-year target, is
required to meet long-term protected area
targets for all ecosystems except marine
pelagic ecosystems. The long-term target for
marine pelagic ecosystems is 214 719 km?,
107 359km? of which should be protected in
the next 20-years. In many cases, targets for
pelagic ecosystems and offshore benthic
ecosystems could be met by the same
protected area as these ecosystems overlap.

Fortunately, large areas required to meet
many of these targets are already included in
existing protected areas. The next section
describes the current level of achievement of
targets within the current protected area
network.

8 The target for marine pelagic systems is not in
addition to offshore benthic targets, as these can
be achieved in overlapping areas

Current achievement of targets

With protected area targets determined for
each ecosystem type, the next step is to
evaluate how much of each ecosystem type is
already effectively conserved in the protected
area network. To do this, we need to
combine the ecosystem map (Figure 4),
ecosystem condition map (Figure 5) and

achievement of these targets.

which 211 896km? should be in protected

30 Importantly, the actual 20-year shortfall is larger than initial inspection of the targets and current protected
areas would suggest because only the intact areas can meet targets and the current protected area extent
includes areas which may be in excess of the minimum area required to meet targets for an individual

ecosystem. See Appendix 2 for more detail.

 212 140km? is needed to secure marine
pelagic ecosystems.

To meet the 20-year targets, we need to add
255 877km’ to the protected area network.
This is made up of 104 962km? required for
marine benthic and coastal ecosystems,

146 814km? for terrestrial ecosystems,

2 352km? for wetlands, 1 490km? for rivers
and 259km’ for estuaries. As discussed
previously, pelagic ecosystems are dealt with
separately and require 104 780km? to meet
the 20-year targets.

It is important to remember that the
aggregated protected area targets in Table 7
are built up from more detailed ecosystem
level targets, which are discussed in the
sections that follow. These specific targets are
crucial for ensuring that protected area
expansion doesn’t just provide more
protection for already well-protected
ecosystems.

The ‘protection level’ of an ecosystem
provides a simple way to visualise and
understand how well ecosystems are
represented in the protected area network.
The ecosystem protection level is evaluated
using the same methods and categories as the
NBA (Table 8). These categories range from
‘Not Protected’, through intermediate
categories to ‘Well Protected’. The number of
ecosystems in each of these categories are
reported per biozone in Table 9 and mapped
in Figure 6.

Of the 969 distinct ecosystem types, 201
(21%) are Well Protected, 122 (13%) types are
Moderately Protected, 286 (30%) ecosystem
types are Poorly Protected, while 360 (37%)
ecosystem types are Not Protected. The
following sections explore the ecosystem
protection levels of marine, inland aquatic
and terrestrial ecosystem groups in more
detail.

ecosystems), river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine (including pelagic) ecosystems.

Achievement of marine targets

There are very distinct patterns of
achievement of protected area targets for
marine ecosystems (Figure 7). Coastal
ecosystems are generally the best protected
of the marine biozones. 273km* of coastal
ecosystems, out of a target of 322km/?, has
already been protected, with 91km’ still being
required to meet the full long-term target and
47km?to meet the 20-year target (Table 7).
Figure 7 shows that 12 coastal ecosystem
types (38%) are Well Protected, 14 are
Moderately Protected (44%), 3 are Poorly
Protected (9%) and 3 are Not Protected (9%).
Despite this relatively healthy situation, some
important gaps remain. Firstly, the West Coast
is very under-protected, with 5 of the Poorly
Protected and Not Protected ecosystem types
being found here. Secondly, to properly
secure marine ecosystems, at least 75% of

each ecosystem’s targets should be included
into no-take zones. ‘Controlled’ or ‘take’
zones in marine protected areas can actually
become nodes for increased exploitation by
facilitating fishing access, rather than
providing protection. Urgent attention should
be given to reducing the impact of
recreational fishing activities in the controlled
zones within marine protected areas. The
current pressure to downgrade some long-
standing marine protected areas from no-take
to ‘controlled’ could undermine recent
progress in marine protected area
declaration.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

24
 The remaining shallow water systems (i.e.
inner shelf, inshore, island, and lagoon) show
variation in terms of current inclusion in the
protected area network. Overall, 2 ecosystem
types (12%) are Not Protected, 5 types (29%)
are Poorly Protected, 7 types (41%) are
Moderately Protected and 3 types (18%) are
Well Protected (Figure 7). The largest gaps are
in the inner shelf and island biozones, where
significant additional areas are required, in
particular along the West Coast where very
few systems have any effective protection. A
number of inshore types along the East and

South-East Coast have some level of
protection, with most of the 3 Well Protected
and 5 Moderately Protected Inshore types
being found along this coast. The single
lagoon ecosystem (Langebaan) is Moderately
Protected. For all these ecosystems, a key
issue is that even where there is some
protection, few of these areas are declared
no-take reserves.

25
 The full target is met for the Southern Oceans,
since declaration of the recent marine
protected area. In contrast, mainland offshore
benthic marine ecosystems currently have
almost no protection, with 41 types (68%)
categorised as Not Protected (Figure 7).
Protection levels of marine pelagic

ecosystems are even worse, with protected
areas securing only 2% of the 20-year target.
This is reflected by the fact that 14 types
(88%) are Not Protected with the remaining 2
types (12%) being Poorly Protected.
Fortunately, this situation is currently
changing with the declaration of marine
protected areas through Operation Phakisa.

To summarise, the focus for marine protected
area expansion in the next five years should
be securing the improved protection of
marine ecosystems through Operation
Phakisa. In addition, significant progress is
needed in inshore regions and some coastal
regions, particularly along the West Coast. A
key issue is declaring sufficient no-take areas
to ensure that marine ecosystems are
effectively secured against fishing pressure.
Otherwise, the benefits of declaring marine
protected areas will be undermined.

The focus for marine protected area
expansion should be on improved
protection of marine ecosystems through

Operation Phakisa, and on under-protected

inshore and coastal regions, particularly
along the West Coast. Sufficient no-take
areas are needed to effectively secure
marine ecosystems.

Achievement of targets for inland
aquatic ecosystems

Unlike in the NPAES 2008, specific targets
have now been set for inland aquatic
ecosystems (rivers, wetlands and estuaries).
All three inland aquatic biozones are very
poorly represented in the protected area
network (Figure 8), which has a traditional
bias towards terrestrial ecosystems. Further,
many of the aquatic ecosystems that do occur
within protected area boundaries are often in
poor condition and are, therefore, not
effectively secured.

tic ecosystems (rivers, wetlands and estuaries).

 

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

26
 This is most obvious in estuaries, where even
though the current protected area network of
724km? exceeds the total required to meet
targets, there is still a shortfall in actual target
achievement (Table 7). This results from two
issues. Firstly, although some large estuaries
are conserved and targets are exceeded for
those types, many ecosystems remain
unprotected. Secondly, much of the estuary
area within protected areas is in fact in a poor
condition due to catchment related impacts
and hence does not contribute to meeting
targets.

Currently, 93% of the 43 estuary types are
effectively Not Protected (Figure 8). Overall,
259km? of additional estuary protection is
necessary over the next 20 years. Securing
estuaries effectively in the protected area
network is going to require both expansion
into under-protected types and improved
management of estuaries and their
catchments.

Rivers are very poorly represented within the
protected area network, with 69 ecosystem
types (33%) being classified as Not Protected,
and 79 (37%) as Poorly Protected. The
remaining 63 types are fairly evenly spread
between Moderately Protected (12%) and
Well Protected types (18%). Currently, river
ecosystems are well below targets, with only
871km? both protected and in acceptable
condition. In order to secure full
representation of rivers, an additional

2 009km? of river ecosystems is required in
the long-term, of which 1 490km? is needed
within 20 years (Table 7).

Protection of rivers is particularly important
as they represent vital ecological
infrastructure for the country, i.e. they are
responsible for delivering important
ecosystem services to people. As was the case

31 Nel et al., 2011.

for estuaries, protection of rivers is not
ensured merely by including the river within a
protected area, though this is a good starting
point. Full protection requires that
catchments are effectively managed, that
important areas for generating runoff are
secured (i.e. South Africa’s Strategic Water
Source Areas**), that abstraction is carefully
controlled, and that riparian areas and
floodplains are maintained.

Wetlands are even more poorly represented
in the protected area network than river
ecosystems. As many as 53 wetland
ecosystem types (39%) are Not Protected,
with an additional 40 types (29%) being Poorly
Protected. Long-term targets are only met for
the 24 types (18%) which are Well Protected,
with another 19 types (14%) categorised as
Moderately Protected. The very poor
protection of wetlands is illustrated by the
fact that of the 4 039km? long-term and

3 176km? 20-year targets required, only

1 139km? is met by wetlands that are both
included acceptable condition and ina
protected area (Table 7). Consequently, a
significant shortfall of 3 135km? exists in the
long-term and 2 352km? is required over the
next 20-years. It is clear that a far more
targeted protection effort is required in order
that South Africa sufficiently secures its
wetlands. As was the case for rivers, wetlands
represent key ecological infrastructure, and
securing them can maintain important
benefits in terms of the delivery of ecosystem
services to people.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

27
 In summary, inland aquatic ecosystems
(rivers, wetlands and estuaries) are very
poorly represented in protected areas, and
many of the areas that are included are in
poor condition. There is a dual challenge to
substantially improve the protected area
coverage of inland aquatic systems and at the
same time secure their functioning. This
requires careful management of catchments,
securing effective management of key areas
such as water source areas, floodplains and
riparian areas, as well as improved
management of wetlands within current
protected areas. Although the challenge is
great, the benefits are potentially far greater,
as inland aquatic ecosystems are amongst
South Africa’s most important ecological
infrastructure.

Inland aquatic ecosystems are important
ecological infrastructure, but are very
poorly represented in protected areas, and
many of the areas that are included are in
poor condition. There is a dual challenge to
substantially improve the protected area
coverage of inland aquatic systems and at
the same time secure their functioning.

Achievement of terrestrial targets
(mainland and Sub-Antarctic)

Overall, of the 445 mainland terrestrial
ecosystem types, 25% are Well Protected,
12% are Moderately Protected, 33% are
Poorly Protected and 30% are Not Protected
(Figure 9). The overall low levels of protection
are emphasised when one examines the
actual targets (Table 7). Of the long-term
target of 257 671km? and the 20-year target
of 202 604km?, only 93 381km? is currently
included in the protected area network in
acceptable condition. This leaves a long-term
requirement for 195 793km/?, of which

146 814km? is required over 20-years. This
equates to 36 703km? in 5-years or 7 340km?
per year (i.e. 734 000ha a year). It is clear that
South Africa is a long way from having a fully a
protected area network that is fully
representative of all mainland terrestrial
ecosystems In a welcome contrast to the
mainland systems, all five Sub-Antarctic
terrestrial ecosystem types are fully included
in the protected area network.

If we examine the individual biozones, it is
clear that there is much variation in
protection (Figure 10). Forests are by far the
best protected, with 9 ecosystem types (75%)
being Well Protected and the remaining 3
types (25%) being Moderately Protected.

 None of the other terrestrial biozones have
similar levels of protection. The Desert
biozone has 6 types (40%) categorised as Well
Protected, but 8 types (53%) are Not
Protected. Effectively, Desert ecosystems in
the west and east are well represented, but
central types are not. There is a similar
situation for Fynbos ecosystems, with 43
types (35%) being Well Protected, but 41
types (34%) remain Poorly Protected and 31
types (25%) are Not Protected. Many
mountain and some coastal Fynbos
ecosystems are well represented by the
protected area network, but lowland and
midland types remain very poorly conserved.
Savanna has a similar contrast, with 28% Well
Protected ecosystem types, but 33% that
remain Poorly Protected and 20% are Not
Protected. Large Savanna focused protected
areas secure the Lowveld and the arid
Savannas, but much of the remaining mesic
Savanna is very poorly protected. Hence, even
in biozones that initially appear relatively well
conserved there significant gaps in protection.
These poorly represented ecosystems are just
as deserving of protection as any other under-
protected type, and the need to protect them
is not reduced by good protection of other
ecosystems in their biozone.

Overall, the Nama-Karoo is South Africa’s least
protected biozone, with 8 types (57%)
categorised as Not Protected, and an
additional 5 types (36%) remain Poorly
Protected. In the past, protection of the
Nama-Karoo was not seen as urgent because
there were no imminent threats and it
appeared that opportunities for protection
would be available for the foreseeable future.
However, shale gas exploration and
production could now potentially foreclose
protected area expansion opportunities
across much of the Nama-Karoo. This
illustrates how protected area expansion
efforts should be balanced between securing

remaining fragments of already pressured
ecosystems, with strategically securing areas
before they become fragmented. It is clear
that protected area expansion in the Nama-
Karoo has suddenly become urgent and that
opportunities for significant protection at low
cost may have already been lost.

Grasslands are the second most under-
represented terrestrial biozone, with 24 types
(33%) being classified as Not Protected and 37
types (51%) as Poorly Protected. Few choices
exist for meeting protected area targets in
Grasslands because of many competing land
and resource uses, and there is a need to act
quickly to secure remaining options. The
Succulent Karoo is in a very similar position to
the Grasslands, 30 types (47%) are Not
Protected and 15 types (23%) are Poorly
Protected. Expansion of protected areas in the
remaining under-represented types in the
Succulent Karoo is also a priority.

In summary, terrestrial biozones show
variable levels of protection. Sub-Antarctic
ecosystem types are fully protected. Some
ecosystems within Forests, Deserts and
Savannas have good protection, but other
ecosystems in these biozones remain under-
protected. The most under-protected
biozones are the Nama-Karoo, Grasslands and
Succulent Karoo. In these biozones it is
important to take all opportunities for further
protection, as competing land and resource
uses continue to expand.

Sub-Antarctic ecosystems are fully
protected, but the Nama-Karoo, Grassland
and Succulent Karoo biozones remain
significantly under-represented. Protected
area expansion in these biozones is urgent,
as competing land and resource uses
continue to reduce opportunities for
protection.

 5. Priority areas for protected area expansion

Having set protected area targets, the next step is to determine which geographic areas are the
highest priorities for protected area expansion to meet those targets.

The NPAES takes the approach that the national role is not to undertake the spatial planning, but
rather to set targets, identify key underlying planning principles, collate the provincial and sector
priorities, and identify any remaining gaps. The strategy recognizes that detailed planning,
scheduling and operational issues are all best dealt with at the provincial and agency level. In the
NPAES 2008, spatial priorities had to be established nationally as few provinces or agencies had
conservation plans and even fewer had specific sets of protected area expansion priorities. This has
changed sufficiently for a set of priority areas to be collated directly from provincial and agency
plans. The NPAES 2016 brings together these priorities, and highlights ecosystems where, if fully
implemented, the current set of priorities will not achieve targets.

The identified priority areas cover a total area of 190 109km/, in addition to areas currently under
negotiation covering 73 610km*? of mostly marine areas. The priority areas for each province, as well
as for marine systems, are summarized. Overall, the set of priorities is well aligned with

requirements for improving the representation of most ecosystems over the next 20 years. The
number of Well Protected ecosystems is anticipated to more than double, while Not Protected
ecosystems will reduce by around 70%. Assuming effective implementation the priority areas,
greatest progress is anticipated in the Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna, wetlands, rivers and

offshore benthic and pelagic ecosystems.

Chapter 4 addressed how much intact and
functional area of each ecosystem type should
be included in the protected area network if it
is to be fully representative and play its role in
ensuring that no further ecosystems become
Critically Endangered. Once targets have been
set, the next step is to determine which
geographic areas are the highest priorities for
protected area expansion to meet those
targets.

Although the overall aim should be improving
the representivity and efficiency of the
protected area network, planning needs to
take a far wider set of issues into account.
These include detailed analysis of important
areas for ecosystem processes (e.g. to secure
areas against the impacts of climate change),
and the identification of key areas of
ecological infrastructure that will ensure that

protected areas contribute to delivering key
ecosystem services to people. Further,
implementation prioritisation should reflect
operational requirements (e.g. consolidation
of protected areas to aid management) and
the implementation mechanisms being used
(e.g. the use of biodiversity stewardship
programmes).

When the NPAES 2008 was developed, most
provinces did not have systematic
conservation plans and even fewer had
specified sets of protected area expansion
priorities. It was therefore necessary to
prioritise at a national level. Little was known
about inland aquatic and marine priorities.
This situation has changed substantially, with
most provinces, agencies and sectors having
robust and systematically identified spatial
priorities. All terrestrial, freshwater and

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

31
 marine areas now have functional protected
area expansion strategies (PAES).

The national planning approach is therefore
no longer necessary or appropriate, and
instead the role of the NPAES 2016 is to set
targets, review the collated spatial priorities
and identify gaps, rather than undertaking its
own spatial prioritisation. The NPAES 2016 is
therefore collated from the protected area
expansion priorities of the individual
protected area agencies. The strategy
recognises that detailed protected area
expansion planning is best dealt with at the
provincial and agency level. Many planning
issues (e.g. ecosystem service issues,
identification of ecological infrastructure,
protected area management issues,
implementation negotiations, and
practicalities of expansion in particular areas)
are most effectively dealt with at a sub-
national level. Hence, the NPAES focuses on
the overall principles which should be applied
during protected area expansion planning at
the agency and provincial level.

In this chapter, the priority areas for each
province, as well as for marine systems, are
summarised in terms of how they were
identified, their location, the key biodiversity

Detailed planning is best dealt with at
provincial and agency level. Protected area
priorities are now available at this level for
all terrestrial, freshwater and marine areas.
The role of the NPAES 2016 is to collate
these priorities and identify gaps, rather
than undertaking national prioritisation.

features, and the key pressures on these
priority areas. The anticipated situation in
terms of protection levels of terrestrial, river,
wetland, estuarine and marine ecosystems is
evaluated assuming all the priority areas are

successfully implemented. The ecosystems
that are not fully addressed by the current set
of priority areas are identified. Further, we
evaluate the anticipated rate of
implementation of priority areas in terms of
the current implementation rates from the
provinces and agencies.

Key principles for planning and
implementation

It is anticipated that, over time, provinces and
agencies will refine, revise and adapt their
systematic conservation plans and PAES as
implementation is rolled out, landscapes
change (e.g. loss of intact habitat), knowledge
is improved (e.g. revised ecosystem mapping)
and planning processes are improved. The
following key principles are intended to guide
further protected area expansion planning
and implementation, so that robust
prioritisation is maintained:

Systematic approach: Protected area
expansion planning should be closely linked to
spatial priorities identified in provincial
systematic conservation plans. In other cases,
the planning may take place at a broader scale
(e.g. for marine systems) or more locally (e.g.
systematic expansion planning for a particular
protected area). There should be strong
alignment with identified Critical Biodiversity
Areas and Ecological Support Areas (or
equivalent categories). In most cases the
identified protected area expansion priorities
should be a subset of these categories in the
applicable systematic conservation plan for an
area.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

32
 Target driven: Prioritisation should focus on
meeting targets for ecosystems. There should
be a clear link between national targets and
those used in local level planning. This issue is
linked to the following two key points on
representation and efficiency.

Improve representation of all ecosystems:
Overall, planning for expansion of a protected
area network should strive to improve
representation of all ecosystems. It may not
be possible, cost-effective or necessary to
secure the full target for all ecosystem types
through a protected area mechanism. Other
effective conservation mechanisms may be
more appropriate in some cases (e.g.
appropriate zoning or development controls
could be used in urban situations).
Nevertheless, the starting point should be
that all ecosystems should be represented in
the protected area network to some extent,
and that one should attempt to secure as
much of the ecosystem targets in protected
areas as is practically possible.

Improve efficiency: There are many valid
reasons to have a greater portion of an
ecosystem protected than the targets require.
For example, a protected area may have a
significant economic, social or tourism role; it
may be necessary to protect some other
biodiversity feature (e.g. a key threatened
species); or it may be necessary to secure a
larger area to protect ecological infrastructure
and ensure long-term climate change
persistence. For ecosystem types with a
limited extent, it may not be effective to only
protect a portion of the system. In other
instances, significant gains in management
efficiency may override representation
efficiency. However, the overall aim should be
to improve the efficiency of meeting targets.
This implies that where targets for an
ecosystem have already been met, there
needs to be a clear and rational reason for

including more of that ecosystem before
under-represented ecosystems are addressed.

Ecological persistence: Protected areas
should secure areas critical for maintaining
ecological process. This will ensure that
protected areas themselves are able to adapt
to climate change and that they contribute to
society as a whole adapting to climate change
impacts. Key areas include coastal and inland
corridors, areas important for hydrological
process (e.g. riparian areas), and areas with
important altitudinal, climatic and ecological
gradients.

Ecological infrastructure: Protected area
planning should include issues related to the
protection of natural areas that deliver critical
ecosystem services to people. Ecological
infrastructure linked to water-related
ecosystem services are particularly critical,
e.g. Strategic Water Source Areas.

Integrated planning across ecosystem types:
Ideally planning should take place across
terrestrial, river, wetland and marine systems
to ensure that optimal areas are selected that
will deliver a complete set of priority areas.

Integrated planning for threatened species:
Priorities for threatened species should be
fully incorporated into the analysis.

Alignment between provinces and agencies:
Where ecosystems are shared between
provinces, or where multiple agencies are
active in a province, it is critical that clear
communication lines exist and that planning
processes are linked. This is necessary to
ensure that priorities are aligned. For
example, one should ensure that activities are
not artificially focused in difficult to
implement areas (e.g. where one province has
a highly fragmented portion of an ecosystem
that would be better protected in an adjacent
province), that shared priority areas are
consistently dealt with, and that boundary

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

33
 areas between biozones (e.g. coastal areas)
are sensibly planned. Where a national agency
is operating in a portion of a province it
should take provincial priorities into account,
and conversely, provinces should incorporate
the national agency’s priorities.

Address receding opportunities: Where
limited opportunities exist to secure the last
remaining portions of under-represented
ecosystems, it is critical that these are
prioritised. Although it may not be possible or
cost-effective to secure all these areas
through protected area expansion, it is
important that this decision is made ona
rational basis and that alternative

mechanisms are used to secure these areas.
At the other extreme, there may be some
remaining large unfragmented landscapes
where opportunities exist to secure protected
areas where there are currently fewer
competing land and resource uses. These
areas should be secured before opportunities
are lost.

Incorporate issues of opportunity cost: A key
issue is that some areas may be very
expensive for protected area expansion or
difficult to secure, and can absorb a great deal
of the protected area expansion effort for not
much gain in terms of contributing to
biodiversity targets. The balance between
securing critical or irreplaceable sites and
other sites that may contribute more
effectively to meeting targets should be
carefully considered. In some cases, it may be
better to secure these difficult areas through
other conservation mechanisms such as
development controls or zoning.

Other operational and economic issues:
Protected areas need to be manageable, so
operational issues need to be taken into
account. Similarly, protected areas should
contribute to the national, regional and local
economy especially through tourism. These

are all legitimate reasons for prioritising
particular areas for expansion. However, care
must be taken to ensure that these issues do
not override all the above core principles
aimed at securing a representative,
ecologically sustainable and efficient reserve
network.

Overall, protected area agencies should aim
for a balanced portfolio of expansion activities
which contribute to biodiversity conservation
and ecological sustainability. They should
avoid reinforcing existing biases in the
protected area network by not protecting
more of the same. Priorities should be clearly
defined through a robust systematic planning
process.

Priority areas for protected area
expansion

The NPAES 2016 has collated protected area
expansion priorities from the provincial and
national agencies. These priorities reflect the
spatial priorities from provincial and other
PAES, or alternatively show the areas that are
currently being incorporated into these
provincial and agency strategies. Priorities
were obtained from, and confirmed with, the
various agencies and provinces.

 An overall map of current protected areas,
areas under negotiation and collated priorities
from provinces and agencies is shown in
Figure 11.

The identified priority areas cover a total area
of 184 190km/, in addition to areas currently
under negotiation covering 72 584km? of
mostly marine areas. For comparison, the
current protected area network covers a total
of approximately 282 479km’, the terrestrial
protected areas are 96 610km? and the Prince

Edward Islands marine protected area is
180 862km?.

The following sections detail the priority areas
for each province and summarise them as

Figure 12: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Eastern Cape.

How were the priority areas identified? The Eastern Cape has a provincial conservation plan**, which
had to be significantly updated when the provincial PAES was prepared®°. The update included freshwater
and estuarine priorities, climate change issues and key gaps in the representation of terrestrial ecosystems.
The priority areas represent a finite set of implementation priorities rather than a comprehensive set of
areas required to meet all targets. SANParks priorities were fully included into the provincial plan and hence
were not added separately in the NPAES.

Where are the main priority areas? The main priorities are Pondoland, Qhorha-Manubi, Greater
Baviaanskloof, Katberg-Amathole, the East London Coast, the Sunshine Coast, the St Francis region,
Mountain Zebra to Camdeboo National Parks, around Addo National Park and the North Eastern Cape
interior grasslands.

What are the main biodiversity features? Key biodiversity features targeted are the Pondoland Centre
of Endemism, the high value montane grasslands and forest mosaics of the Katberg-Amathole, the wetland
complexes of Matatiele, remaining pockets of coastal forest and grassland, corridor areas of the Sneeuberg
region, and the under-protected and unique grasslands of the Southern Drakensberg.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? Agriculture (both commercial and subsistence) is an
issue in many of the priority areas, new forestry programs are an issue in the east, while coastal urban

How were the priority areas identified? Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife has a well-established and up to date
systematic conservation planning system which identifies a comprehensive set of Critical Biodiversity Areas,
within which protected area expansion priorities are identified**. Key issues include targeting irreplaceable
and under-represented biodiversity features and important landscape corridors.

Where are the main priority areas? Most irreplaceable features are in the midland and coastal regions.
In addition, there are critical landscape linkages including the Kokstad to Port Edward, Bulwer, Nottingham
Road, Glencoe to Umtunzini, and Zululand/Maputaland corridors.

What are the main biodiversity features? Key features include the remaining areas of irreplaceable,
highly threatened and under-represented Sub-escarpment Grassland, Sub-escarpment Savanna and Indian
Ocean Coastal Belt. In addition, key landscape corridors are targeted. The planning process fully
incorporates aquatic and species priorities.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? Urban residential and commercial expansion in the
coastal areas are the key pressures, while commercial and subsistence agriculture are an issue inland.

How were the priority areas identified? Mpumalanga has an up to date and comprehensive systematic
conservation plan?®, from which a subset of areas was prioritised for the provincial PAES®®. The prioritisation
focused on meeting biodiversity targets for ecosystems, species and process areas. Key issues were
landscape connectivity and securing threatened ecosystems.

Where are the main priority areas? Although a very comprehensive set of areas have been identified,
the key priority areas are the Loskop-Middelburg region, the Steenkampsberg, Vaalhoek (near Blyde
Canyon), Kaapsehoop and Schoemanskloof on the escarpment, the Slaaihoek and Badplaas region and
around Wakkerstroom.

What are the main biodiversity features? The plan focuses on key corridors, priority intact grasslands,
unprotected threatened species, threatened ecosystems and areas with remaining wilderness
characteristics. Most priorities are in the Mesic Highveld Grasslands.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? Rapid expansion of mining (especially for coal) is the
primary threat in the priority areas. In addition, significant pressures exist from commercial and subsistence
arable agriculture, and to a lesser extent plantation forestry.

Figure 15: Priority areas for protected area expansion in Limpopo

How were the priority areas identified? The Limpopo Province has a relatively recent provincial
systematic conservation plan?” from which a spatially specific provincial protected areas expansion strategy
was developed”. The spatial planning already includes SANParks priority areas and hence these were not
separately added by the NPAES.

Where are the main priority areas? High value sites which are under threat are prioritised, particularly
the Haenertsburg-Modjaqji area, the Blouberg (and adjacent Makgabeng) and the Nyslvlei (and adjacent
Makapan) areas. Further priority areas include the Makuya region, the area around the Wolkberg and the
Drakensberg-Strydpoortberge region. In addition, areas with high land-owner willingness (e.g. Waterberg
and Soutpansberg), and areas with committed champions for protected area expansion (e.g. Kruger to
Canyons Biosphere and areas in the Waterberg Biosphere) are included.

What are the main biodiversity features? The priority areas comprehensively target the full range of
biodiversity features in the province including under-protected terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,
landscape corridors and major areas important for threatened species.

How were the priority areas identified? Gauteng province has a clearly delineated set of spatial
priorities derived from its provincial systematic conservation plan. The Gauteng Protected Areas Expansion
Strategy comprehensively includes the Critical Biodiversity Areas from the Gauteng C-Plan Version 3.3°9

Where are the main priority areas? Key priority areas include the areas in and around the Cradle of
Humankind in the West Rand, the Mesic Highveld Grasslands around Bronkhorstspruit, the Central Bushveld
areas around Hammanskraal in the north of the province, and key connection across the south of the
province linking Suikerbosrand and Sebokeng. Very few options remain in and around the highly urbanised
City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan areas.

What are the main biodiversity features? The full range of important biodiversity features are targeted,
including remain areas of threatened ecosystems, irreplaceable and important features. The priorities also

include wetlands, rivers and their buffers, important ridges, dolomite areas and climate change corridors.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? The key pressure is the expansion of urban areas for a
range of residential, commercial and industrial reasons. Mining is also an important pressure, though less so

Figure 17: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the North West.

How were the priority areas identified? The North West is currently completing an update on its
provincial conservation plan. Critical Biodiversity Areas from this plan, in particular priority areas (i.e.
corridors and priority conservation nodes), were selected as the spatial priorities based on discussion with
the conservation planners and provincial officials. These areas will be formalised into the revised provincial
PAES.

Where are the main priority areas? The major spatial priorities areas are the Platinum Heritage Park in
the north east of the province, the Highveld Park (around Potchefstroom to Boskop Dam Nature Reserve),
the areas around the lower Vaal near SA Lombaard and Bloemhof Dam, Taung, Molemane to Mariko, and
the Molopo area. In addition, some important finer scale corridors are prioritised through the few
remaining intact linkages in the centre of the province.

What are the main biodiversity features? Under-protected ecosystem types, particularly in the Central
Bushveld, Arid Highveld Grasslands and Eastern Kalahari Bushveld ecosystems are important biodiversity
features. There is a strong focus on improving the landscape connectivity between reserves, with a
particular focus on the major connections in the Bushveld areas of the Platinum Heritage Park and the more
tenuous remaining river corridors through the Arid Highveld Grasslands.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 41
 What are the key pressures on priority areas? Commercial dryland agriculture (especially focused on
maize production) is by far the dominant pressure in the province, though mining pressures and subsistence
farming are an issue in the north east.

Figure 18: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Free State.

How were the priority areas identified? The Free State is about to finalise its provincial conservation
plan and protected areas expansion strategy. The plans are robust and systematic, with a clear focus on
improving the representation of under-protected ecosystems. Initial priority areas from the draft provincial
PAES were combined with SANParks expansion areas.

Where are the main priority areas? Three main geographic themes can be seen. The plan includes a
large area of Mesic Highveld Grasslands and Drakensberg Grasslands in the eastern Free State which are
important for ecosystem service delivery. There is a central and southern band of priority areas targeting
very under-protected Dry Highveld Grasslands, and then a smaller set of areas in the west targeting the
upper Nama-Karoo and Eastern Kalahari Bushveld.

What are the main biodiversity features? The plan strongly targets threatened and under-protected
terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in the grasslands. The remaining intact areas of Endangered and
Vulnerable ecosystem types are included in the plan. Freshwater priorities (i.e. FEPA“° rivers and wetlands)
are less directly targeted but are nevertheless built into the overall spatial planning process.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? The greatest pressure on Free State priority areas is

agriculture. Most of this is commercial maize and sunflower production, though in some areas subsistence
agriculture is also an issue. Large dams have also had an impact in the past.

Figure 19: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Western Cape.

How were the priority areas identified? CapeNature has a well-established and up to date systematic
conservation planning system, which is used to identify Critical Biodiversity areas at a fine scale. Priorities
from this planning process were put through a filter based on biodiversity features and operational
requirements to identify a subset of priority areas for protected area expansion that are included in their
PAES. SANParks priorities around existing national parks were also included.

Where are the main priority areas? The priority areas are widely distributed across the province. Key
spatial priorities focus on remaining sites in threatened and under-protected lowland Fynbos systems,
important climate change adaptation corridors, and consolidating areas around and between key reserves.
The main geographical gap in the network is that the Nama-Karoo was largely excluded as it was of lower
priority, but this is now changing with the emergence of shale gas exploration.

What are the main biodiversity features? The plan targets key gaps in the protected area network. It
aims to secure at least one ‘best remaining’ site in each of the province’s most poorly-protected Critically
Endangered ecosystems, secure key sites for important species, secure special (unique, under-protected &
threatened) freshwater ecosystems in each region and also targets marine, estuarine and coastal features.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? Lowland areas are under extreme pressure from urban
and agricultural expansion. Agricultural expansion issues include expansion of potatoes, olives, rooibos and
vineyards. Importantly, unmanaged Fynbos areas can be rapidly degraded through invasion by alien
vegetation and poor fire management.

Figure 20: Priority areas for protected area expansion in the Northern Cape.

How were the priority areas identified? The Northern Cape now has a full Protected Area Expansion
Strategy‘? developed by the Northern Cape Department of Environment and Nature Conservation with
support from the Department of Environmental Affairs. This is based on an up to date systematic
conservation plan for the province*”. The PAES priorities, which are used directly, are largely a subset of the
Critical Biodiversity Areas from the systematic conservation plan that were identified on implementation
priority. SANParks priorities were fully included into the provincial PAES.

Where are the main priority areas? The priority areas are in the Succulent Karoo areas of the Namakwa
District, Bushmanland, the southern Nama-Karoo as well as in the expansion areas of the existing national
parks in the province.

What are the main biodiversity features? Succulent Karoo and southern Nama-Karoo priorities, as well
as river and wetlands are included. Arid Savanna and some Desert ecosystems are currently not fully
included in these of priorities, and these will need to be focussed on after existing priorities have been
implemented.

How were the priority areas identified? These are current areas under negotiation for Phase 1 of
Operation Phakisa, which aims to proclaim a representative network of MPAs that protects at least 5% of
mainland South Africa’s EEZ. The systematically identified priorities were based on assessments for the
Offshore Marine Protected Area Project 20113, the West Coast of South Africa** and assessments
associated with the NBA 2011. Further priorities to take the total to 10% will be identified by 2018.

 What are the main biodiversity features? Biodiversity features include under-protected ecosystems,
sensitive habitats, and threatened ecosystems and species, as well as key nursery, spawning and feeding

areas.

What are the key pressures on priority areas? The current priorities were deliberately designed to
avoid major competing activities and pressures. Nevertheless, until they are declared the priority areas will

still be vulnerable to fishery pressures as well as oil/gas exploration and potential phosphate mining.

Looking forward: Achievements if
the priorities are implemented

This section looks forward to the
achievements that could be made in terms of
representation of ecosystems if all the areas
currently under negotiation and the priority
areas are added to the protected area
network.

Table 10 provides a summary of how the
protection levels for all ecosystems could
change in 20 years, if the current areas under
negotiation and the identified priority areas
are implemented. If we assume that these
areas are secured, the level of representation
of South Africa’s ecosystems will be
significantly improved.

Should the priorities be implemented, of the
969 distinct ecosystem types, 506 or 52%
(compared to the current 201 or 21%) will be
Well Protected, and 169 or 17% (compared to
the current 122 or 13%) will be Moderately
Protected. For the lower categories of
protection level, 184 or 19% (compared to the
current 286 or 30%) of ecosystem types will
be Poorly Protected, while only 110 or 11%
(compared to the current 360 or 37%) of
ecosystem types will remain Not Protected.
The significant improvement in protection
levels that is anticipated is evident in Figure
22, which can be compared with the current
situation shown in Figure 6.

Under this scenario, an additional 305
ecosystem types would move to the Well
Protected category, while 232 types improve
in protection level by at least one category. A
further 128 types would show some increase
in protected area coverage but not enough to
result in a category change. Based on the
priority areas, greatest progress is anticipated
in the Grasslands, Succulent Karoo, Savanna,
wetlands, rivers and offshore benthic and
pelagic ecosystems.

It is important to note that the full extent of
priority areas is unlikely to be implemented,
as these areas will generally include more of
an ecosystem than is required to meet
targets. Some priority areas may include fine
scale sites not suitable for inclusion into a
protected area. In addition, when detailed
planning takes place, the final implementation

footprint may extend beyond the priority
area. This is to be expected, and is an
inevitable consequence of planning occurring
at a broader scale than final implementation.
Priority area boundaries should never be
literally interpreted as future protected area
boundaries.

 Remaining gaps and revisions of
spatial plans

Implementing the current areas under
negotiation and priority areas would not
improve the situation for 87 ecosystem types.
Approximately half of the ecosystems that
show no improvement are terrestrial, a
quarter are rivers and the remaining types are
spread between the other biozones (Figure
22).

It is important not to interpret the gap
between what can be delivered by securing
the spatial priorities and the requirements for
fully meeting targets, as reflecting poor or
incomplete planning. Different provinces and
agencies have used slightly different, but
equally valid, planning approaches. This
results in some agencies placing a smaller
basket of immediate priorities into the priority
areas, while others prefer to put a far broader
set of areas on the table. This is clearly
illustrated by the contrast between the
Western Cape, where a very specific set of
priority sites which are a small subset of their
Critical Biodiversity Areas has been identified
and the Free State where the priority areas
essentially include the entire set of Critical
Biodiversity Areas from the provincial
conservation plan. These approaches are
different, but each have their advantages.

In the case of marine priorities, the gap
between what is delivered by the current set
of priorities (which have now moved into the
‘negotiated’ category as they have been
gazetted) and the full area required to meet
targets reflects an ongoing political process. It
has been agreed that an additional set of
priorities will be identified once the first set of
Operation Phakisa priorities have been
declared.

In time, it will be necessary to repeat the
provincial and agency protected area
expansion planning processes. This is
necessary as implementation of protected
area expansion programmes will result in the
priority areas needing to be revised. In
general, it should be sufficient to revise these
plans every five years, but if significant
progress is made in a region, then more
frequent updates may be required. In
particular, it will be necessary to identify a
second set of marine priorities once the initial
Operation Phakisa priorities have been
implemented. Where a number of agencies
are active in a province (e.g. a provincial
conservation agency and SANParks), it is
particularly important that protected area
plans are well-aligned.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

 6. Mechanisms for protected area expansion

There are three main mechanisms for expanding the land-based protected area network:

Acquisition of land is the traditional way of establishing and expanding protected areas, but involves

large upfront costs.

Contract agreements are agreements in which landowners maintain ownership of their land but
enter into a contract with a protected area agency. They are facilitated by provisions in the
Protected Areas Act. They are being used increasingly as part of biodiversity stewardship
programmes. Contract agreements are attractive because they tend to cost protected area agencies
less than acquisition, and because by far the largest proportion of land in the priority areas is in
private hands. Biodiversity stewardship programmes are increasingly recognized as an important
mechanism in the expansion of the protected area network. There are significant potential synergies
between biodiversity stewardship programmes, land reform and rural development.

Declaration of public or state land involves reassigning land to a protected area agency from
another organ of state. It has limited applicability because only a small proportion of land in the
priority areas for protected area expansion is public land.

Expansion of the marine protected area network is more complex and mechanisms for securing
protected areas specifically focused on inland aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood.

Once priority areas for protected area
expansion have been identified, it is necessary
to look at mechanisms for expanding the
protected area network in those priority
areas. There are three main mechanisms for
expanding existing land-based protected
areas or establishing new ones:

e Acquisition of land

e Contract agreements, including through
biodiversity stewardship programmes

e Declaration of state or public land

Expansion of the marine protected area
network is more complex. Marine protected
areas are declared in terms of the Protected
Areas Act as amended in June 2014. For
offshore marine protected areas no private
property rights are involved but there are
mining rights, medium- and long-term fishing
rights with annual quotas, and rights of access
at sea that have to be modified, rescinded or

expropriated in order to establish a marine
protected area. Mechanisms for achieving this
have been developed and are being
implemented under Operation Phakisa.

Mechanisms for securing protected areas
specifically focused on inland aquatic
ecosystems are poorly understood. The
current process of securing rivers, wetlands
and estuaries using the methods used for
terrestrial ecosystems has proved largely
ineffective, as even when the features are
fully incorporated into protected areas, they
are still subject to catchment related impacts.
Much work remains to understand how to
properly secure inland aquatic ecosystems
and their associated processes.

The focus in this chapter is on mechanisms for
expanding the land-based protected area
network. Contract agreements are
increasingly used, and provincial biodiversity

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

51
 stewardship programmes have been
strengthened and rolled out to all provinces.
Nevertheless, acquisition of land and
declaration of public land remain appropriate
and important mechanisms for protected area
expansion in some circumstances. Each of the
three mechanisms is discussed briefly below.

Acquisition of land

Acquisition of land through purchase is the
traditional mechanism for expanding the
protected area network. Land is bought by
protected area agencies, either for inclusion
in existing protected areas or to establish a
new protected area. Acquisition is the most
secure option for protected area expansion,
but also usually the costliest option.

Because acquisition is the mechanism that has
been used most in the establishment of the
land-based protected area network to date, it
would be easy to continue to rely on it as the
primary mechanism for expanding the
protected area network. However, it will not
be possible to meet protected area targets
using acquisition alone — the cost would
simply be too great.

Contract agreements, including
biodiversity stewardship

Contractual arrangements for expanding
national parks were made possible by the
National Parks Act (Act 57 of 1976) and have
been used by SANParks especially from the
late 1980s onwards. The Protected Areas Act

has made it possible for contract agreements
to be used in a wider range of contexts since
2003, including by provincial protected area
agencies. In this mechanism, the land
concerned remains in private hands with a
formal contract between the landowner and a
protected area agency. The landowner agrees
to restrictions on use of the land and the
protected area agency commits to various
forms of management assistance. In the most
secure cases, restrictions on use of the land
are written into the title deed and thus

remain in place if the land changes hands. The
landowner of such a contractual protected
area is eligible for exclusion from property
rates in terms of the Municipal Property Rates
Act (Act 6 of 2004).

Contract agreements in terms of the
Protected Areas Act are the most secure of a
series of options for agreements with
landowners that form part of biodiversity
stewardship programmes. The less secure
options require fewer restrictions on the part
of landowners and come with less ongoing
management assistance from the protected
area agency. They are also not recognised in
terms of the Protected Areas Act and thus do
not constitute formal protected areas. These
informal conservation areas can be useful as
‘entry-level’ biodiversity stewardship
agreements, and may lead over time to more
secure contract agreements. Existing
conservation areas can also provide a useful
starting point for pursuing contract
agreements, as long as they fall within
important areas for protected area expansion.

Following on from the pioneering work of
CapeNature, all provincial protected area
agencies now have a functional biodiversity
stewardship programme. The national
biodiversity stewardship policy document is in
an advanced stage of development and is
intended for publication during this phase of
implementation (see Chapter 8). More detail

Biodiversity Stewardship Guideline
Document*’.

Contract agreements involve formal
contracts between landowners and
protected area agencies, in which the
landowner agrees to restrictions on the use
of the land and the protected area agency
commits to various forms of management
assistance. Contract agreements are often
much more cost effective than acquisition
of land and are used increasingly as part of
biodiversity stewardship programmes.

It is important to note that contract
agreements can be used where land is under
communal ownership. As discussed in

Chapter 2, the Richtersveld National Park, the
Makuleke section of Kruger National Park and
iSimangaliso Wetland Park provide good
examples of community ownership of formal
protected areas through contract agreements.
Several biodiversity stewardship agreements
are in negotiation with communities in other
parts of the country. There are significant
potential synergies between land reform,
contract agreements for protected areas, and
biodiversity stewardship programmes.

Contractual protected areas can involve
substantial costs in the process of negotiating
the contract, and require ongoing resources
from the protected area agency to support
the landowner in managing and auditing the
management of the property concerned.
Nevertheless, the overall cost of contractual
protected areas tends to be substantially less
than the cost of acquisition. Thus, so long as
there is adequate budget to cover the actual
costs of contractual protected areas, they
remain an attractive mechanism for protected

area expansion in many circumstances,
especially where land prices are prohibitive.

Protected area agencies should develop a
basket of incentives that can be offered to
landowners in return for entering into
contract agreements, over and above the
existing exclusion from municipal property
rates and the income tax incentives that
support the establishment of contractual
protected areas (see Chapter 7). Additional
incentives that can be combined to suit
landowner preferences include, for example,
technical and professional planning and
operations support, fire management
services, assistance with clearing invasive
alien plants, advice on sustainable harvesting
of natural resources, partnerships in nature-
based commercial ventures, access to
marketing resources, access to expensive
game, fencing supply, and enforcement
support.

Declaration of public or state land

Declaration of public or state land involves
reassigning the management of public or state
land from a national or provincial government
department to a protected area agency.
Where land in priority areas for protected
area expansion is held by the state (for
example, the Department of Public Works,
DAFF, South African National Defence Force)
or by parastatal agencies (for example,
ESKOM), this should be identified and where
possible management of the land should be
assigned to a protected area agency.

It is worth noting that this mechanism has
limited usefulness as a very small proportion
(approximately 4%) of land in the protected
area expansion priority areas is held by the
state. However, where it is possible to use this
mechanism it may be very cost effective

 7. Financing protected area expansion

Protected area institutions can draw on several sources of funding for, and adopt more cost-
effective approaches to, the expansion of protected areas. All funding sources will have an
important role to play, given the size of the task of achieving the ambitious protected area targets.

The following complementary financing mechanisms and implementation approaches should be
considered: funding from the national treasury; income from the use of protected areas; private
voluntary donations; official donor assistance; biodiversity stewardship and biodiversity offsets.

The business case for a national conservation trust fund, with protected area institutions as the
principal beneficiaries, needs to be investigated. This conservation trust fund could, through the
investment of its capital, generate more stable and predictable income flows to finance protected
area expansion and management efforts.

The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN), currently being piloted in South Africa, is intended to
develop a more comprehensive national resource mobilisation strategy for biodiversity conservation
and mainstreaming efforts across the country, and to improve cost-effectiveness. The outcomes
from the BIOFIN project will therefore be extremely relevant to the ongoing pursuit of sustainable
financing strategies for protected area expansion.

The Sustainable Financing Framework for
Management Authorities of State Managed
Protected Areas* highlights that all protected
area institutions cite inadequate funding as a

area institutions from the national fiscus are
not likely to increase significantly. There is a

sources of income to finance the ongoing
costs of protected area expansion, and to
continually improve the ability of protected
area institutions to more cost-effectively
administer the growing protected area estate.

48 DEA, 2015b.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 54
 The following complementary financing
mechanisms and implementation approaches
should be considered:

Funding from the National Treasury: Core
public sector funding mechanisms for
protected area expansion may include budget
allocations, conditional grants, Expanded
Public Works Programme (EPWP) funds”, and
grants from the Green Fund”. In order to
maintain and expand on current levels of
funding from the national treasury, protected
area institutions will need to demonstrate
more effectively the social and economic
benefits of public investments in protected
area expansion.

Income from the use of protected areas:
Increasing the income from direct access to,
and use of resources in, protected areas —
including tourism charges, resource use fees,
payment for ecosystem services, and bio-
prospecting charges — may better enable
protected area institutions to cross-subsidise
the activities associated with the ongoing
expansion of the protected area estate.

Private voluntary donations: Private sources
of funding — including business and
philanthropic foundations, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), conservation trust
funds and private individuals — are an
increasingly important source of financing for
protected area expansion. There is a growing
trend of close collaboration and pooling of
resources between protected area agencies,
the private sector and NGOs. Notably, this
often occurs when linked to the socio-

4° Through the Natural Resource Management
programmes and Environmental Protection and
Infrastructure Programme. Some of this funding is
likely to be restricted to initial implementation
costs associated with protected area expansion
(e.g. fencing and management infrastructure)
rather than land costs.

5° Funding from EPWP and the Green Fund may be
used as an incentive for the negotiation of

economic development of rural communities
living in and around protected areas.

Official donor assistance: While donor
investments are typically short- to medium-
term and catalytic in nature, bilateral and
multilateral donor agencies may provide
financial and technical support to land
acquisition and contractual negotiations with
private and communal landowners. The
Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the
Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF)
are particularly important sources of funding
that can be mobilised for supporting
protected area expansion efforts.

Biodiversity stewardship (contractual
agreements): Biodiversity stewardship
programmes represent a cost-effective
strategy for expanding the protected area
estate while avoiding the need for land
purchases.

In order to make biodiversity stewardship
more effective, a number of incentives can be
used to support landowners and communities
entering into contractual agreements. These
include:

e Fiscal incentives — economic incentives
based on government revenue or
expenditure®™

e = Technical and professional advice and
support

e Management assistance and support

e Partnerships in nature-based commercial
ventures

e Access to marketing resources

contractual agreements or as a source of
government co-financing for donor funds.

51 For example, recent amendments to the
Taxation Laws (March 2015) specifically deal with
tax incentives for landowners who have entered
into a contractual agreement to declare their land
as a protected area.

 e Public recognition

Biodiversity offsets*”: South Africa has
already implemented a number of biodiversity
offsets projects and the DEA, along with some
provinces, are in the process of developing
guidelines for environmental offsets.
Biodiversity offsets hold the potential to shift
some of the burden for financing the
expansion of protected areas from the
national fiscus to the private sector.

Biodiversity offsets provide a mechanism to
compensate for residual negative impacts on
biodiversity after all feasible and reasonable
alternatives have been considered during the
planning of a proposed development. The
biodiversity offset mechanism enables land
that was not previously designated as a
protected area to be declared and for the
management costs to be secured.

Priority areas for protected area expansion
should be the major receiving sites for offsets,
rather than ad hoc and individually identified
sites. Careful planning will be necessary to
ensure that offsets are efficiently
implemented, that they contribute optimally
to protected area expansion and
management, and do not place an undue
burden on protected area agencies. A key
issue is securing ongoing management costs.

National conservation trust fund: The
business case for a national conservation trust
fund, with protected area institutions as the
principal beneficiaries, needs to be
investigated as a means of centralising the
function of attracting grants and donations
from bilateral and multilateral development
agencies and private donors. This
conservation trust fund could generate,

The Biodiversity Finance Initiative

The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN),
managed by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the
European Commission and the Governments
of Germany and Switzerland, is in the process
of being piloted in South Africa (amongst 29
other countries) under the auspices of the
DEA. BIOFIN is intended to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the funding gap for
the local implementation of the CBD’s Aichi
biodiversity targets — including the expansion
of protected areas — and should provide much
needed perspective on this issue. BIOFIN also
aims to develop a comprehensive national
resource mobilisation strategy, and improve
cost effectiveness through the mainstreaming
of biodiversity into national development and
sector planning. The outcomes from the
BIOFIN project will therefore be extremely
pertinent to the ongoing pursuit of
sustainable financing strategies by protected
area institutions.

 8. Implementation of the NPAES

Protected area agencies, including provincial conservation authorities, SANParks, DAFF and DEA, are
the primary implementers of the NPAES. Most of these agencies have developed their own PAES and
implementation plans, which are increasingly better aligned with the NPAES targets and priority
areas.

DEA (through Working Group 1 of MINMEC) will work to ensure better alignment of the efforts of
the multiple agencies involved in protected area expansion, will provide a forum for discussing
challenges and sharing lessons, and track progress towards meeting protected area targets.

A detailed 5-year action plan with annual implementation targets, derived from the provincial plans,
has been developed and is presented in this chapter.

Who implements the NPAES?

Protected area agencies are the primary
implementers of the NPAES. These include the
provincial conservation authorities (agencies
and government departments), SANParks,

and the Oceans and Coasts Branch of DEA.
The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (DAFF) manages protected areas
under the National Forest Act rather than the
Protected Areas Act. Thus, although forest
reserves contribute to the national efforts to
expand protected areas, they do not fall
under the same reporting and accountability
regimes. Protected area agencies are
supported in their implementation of the
NPAES by a range of organisations including
DEA, the South African National Biodiversity
Institute (SANBI), National Treasury, provincial
environment departments and conservation
NGOs.

Protected area agencies are the primary
implementers of the NPAES. These include
provincial conservation authorities
(agencies and government departments),

SANParks, DAFF and the Oceans and Coasts

Branch of DEA.

Many protected area agencies have
developed, and are implementing, their own
agency-specific protected area expansion
strategies (PAES). The NPAES and these
agency-specific PAESs need to be closely
aligned to ensure that the national targets are
met through the collective efforts of the
individual protected area agencies.

With multiple agencies implementing
protected area expansion, it is also necessary
to ensure a level of co-ordination in
monitoring and reporting on the
implementation of the strategy. Working
Group 1 of MINMEC, is convened by DEA with
representation from protected area agencies,
SANBI, and relevant national NGOs, and is
ideally suited to play a key role in this respect.
This will ensure that there is alignment of the
efforts of the multiple agencies involved in
protected area expansion, will provide a
forum for discussing challenges and sharing
lessons, and track annual progress towards
meeting protected area expansion targets.

 Phased implementation of the
NPAES

The NPAES presents a long-term, 20-year and
5-year strategy for the expansion of protected
areas in South Africa. The quantification of the
spatial targets for individual ecosystems, and
the identification of the priority areas for
meeting these long-term, 20-year and 5-year
targets, are fully described in Chapter 4 and
Chapter 5 respectively.

The implementation of the NPAES is guided by
5-year targets. The implementation of the 20-
year strategy for protected area expansion is
thus structured into four implementation
phases.

Phase 1 of the implementation of the NPAES,
— covering the period 2008 — 2014, has now
been completed and a brief review of the
progress made in protected area expansion is
described in Chapter 3.

Action plan for phase 2 of the
NPAES implementation

The implementation plan presented here
covers the second phase (2016 — 2020) of the
20-year strategy of the NPAES**. At the
national level, the priority activities and
targets required to “support and align the
efforts of protected area agencies in the
ongoing expansion of protected areas, and
track progress towards meeting long-term
protected area system targets” have been
collated into a 5-year action plan. The action
plan is presented in Table 11.

While the NPAES sets national level targets,
the action plan does not deal with the
detailed planning and implementation for

convened by DEA and to which representatives of
all protected area agencies were invited.

expanding protected areas at the provincial
and local levels. This level of planning and
implementation is most appropriately done by
the responsible protected area agencies, using
the NPAES as an overarching framework to
guide local actions. Each protected area
institution should continue to update, align
and implement their institution-based PAESs
to ensure that they will collectively contribute
to meeting the national short- and medium-
term targets contained in the NPAES.

 9. Information gaps, research priorities and legislative reform priorities

 

Key information gaps for the NPAES include the ongoing development of an accurate spatial layer of
existing protected areas and a national spatial data layer on land ownership and tenure. This chapter
details a number of research priorities that would help to fill information gaps. Research priorities
include further exploration of the role of protected areas in supporting ecosystem-based adaptation
to climate change. Ecologically meaningful biodiversity targets for aquatic ecosystems need to be
developed. Exploration of innovative ways to consider land price and opportunity costs in the
identification of priority areas for protected area expansion are needed, as well as investigation of
the likely costs of different mechanisms for protected area expansion into the future. Also useful
would be additional research into the relative income and job creation potential of regular
agriculture compared with protected areas and ecotourism. Finally, pilot projects are needed to
evaluate the ways in which biodiversity stewardship agreements can used to support land reform

and rural development.

Several information gaps, research needs and
legislative reform priorities were adequately
addressed during the implementation of
phase 1 of the NPAES.

Outstanding information gaps that need to be
addressed include:

e Continual updating and improving spatial
information on the distribution of
protected areas in the Protected Area
Register. This includes verifying protected
area boundaries, their proclamation
status and management effectiveness. In
particular, the privately owned protected
areas included in the Protected Area
Register but declared under pre-Protected
Area Act legislation need to be verified.

e The potential inclusion of areas protected
by ‘other effective area-based measures’
should be evaluated and potentially
included in the assessment of target
achievement. Robust criteria need to be
set up to ensure that only intact, well-
managed areas with long-term security of
biodiversity are included.

e New biodiversity data is routinely being
collected but does not always find its way
into the planning data sets. More

streamlined mechanisms for the inclusion
of new biodiversity distribution data into
the planning data sets are required.
Mapping and classification of specific
marine ecosystems at a finer scale is
necessary, especially for vulnerable
marine habitats e.g. reefs, sponge beds
and kelp forests.

Mapping marine ecological processes, for
example spawning and nursery grounds
and foraging areas for marine species.
The identification of remaining focus
areas (after implementation of Phase 1 of
Operation Phakisa) required to meet
marine targets is a priority.

The specific biodiversity offset receiving
areas which will optimally contribute to
protected area expansion need to be
identified and agreed on.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

64
 Outstanding research priorities that still need
to be addressed include:

Further exploration of the role of
protected areas in supporting ecosystem-
based adaptation to climate change.
Research on ecologically meaningful
biodiversity targets for marine, estuarine
and freshwater ecosystems.

Innovative ways to consider land price
and opportunity costs in the identification
of priority areas for protected area
expansion.

Strategic use of biodiversity offsets to
expand the protected area network and
secure its ongoing management costs
needs to be investigated.

Outstanding legislative reform priorities
include:

A need to properly secure the legal status
and management of mountain catchment

areas. These were declared in terms of
the Mountain Catchment Areas Act, which
was forestry legislation at that stage
falling under the DEA. There is no
consensus on the administration of the
Mountain Catchment Areas Act and the
responsible regulating authority for
mountain catchment areas. This is an
important matter to resolve given the
significant contribution that mountain
catchment areas make to protected area
targets and the vital role they play in
providing ecosystem services.

A need to explore legal and institutional
mechanisms for implementing freshwater
conservation areas. This will include
potential links between the Biodiversity
Act and mechanisms provided by the
National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998), the
National Water Resource Strategy and the
National Water Resource Classification
System.

 Appendix 2: Supporting technical notes

This appendix provides more detailed background information beyond what could be included in the
main document. The key sections covered in the appendix are:

e Technical Note 1: More detailed information on the approach and principles used to set targets.

e Technical Note 2: The detailed method for calculating targets.

e Technical Note 3: Supporting information on the creation of the integrated ecosystem map.

e Technical Note 4: Supporting information on the creation of the integrated ecosystem condition
map.

Technical Note 1: Protected area targets

Protected area targets are action targets that indicate how much of each ecosystem should be
included in protected areas, thus guiding protected area expansion to focus on ecosystems that are
least protected. Internationally, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to which South Africa is
a signatory, commits governments to a range of targets generally known as Aichi biodiversity
targets. Target 11 states that “by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10
per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and
ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically
representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based
conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes”. The key issues to
highlight are that the CBD is very specific about the network needing to be ecologically
representative and that the targets need to be met by intact habitat that is ecologically functional
and is conserved in protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. Further,
the flat targets of 17% and 10% are relatively arbitrary, and are politically decided rather than based
on ecologically rationale.

South Africa has a well-established system of systematic biodiversity planning which uses
biodiversity targets to determine which areas of the landscape and seascape are most important
for conserving a representative sample of biodiversity pattern (ecosystems and species) and for
keeping key ecological processes intact. These targets are used as the basis for national monitoring
of Ecosystem Threat Status and Protection Levels in the National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA)°?.
The system, and specific values, of thresholds set out in the NBA is widely used and well-accepted
across South Africa. These thresholds are widely used in national systematic biodiversity planning
processes such as the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas Assessment (NFEPA)®,
prioritization for marine protected areas in projects such as the Offshore Marine Protected Area
(OMPA) Project 2011, and the National Estuary Biodiversity Plan for South Africa 2012. The same
ecosystem targets are used in provincial conservation plans. Biodiversity targets for terrestrial
ecosystems in South Africa range from 16% to 36% of the original extent of each ecosystem, with

5° The targets are often called biodiversity thresholds. See Driver et al. 2012 for explanations of the thresholds,
the systematic conservation planning approach used in South Africa and details on the biodiversity targets, how
they are determined, and how they are used in the evaluations of ecosystem protection level.

 higher thresholds for more variable and species-rich ecosystems. In the absence of better data, a
20% biodiversity threshold is used for marine, river, wetland and estuarine systems.

The NPAES 2008 set long-term protected area targets equal to the biodiversity targets, so that
protected area targets would have an underlying science-basis reflecting the ecological
requirements for protecting ecosystems effectively. The long-term goal was to incorporate into the
protected area network at least that proportion of each ecosystem required to meet its biodiversity
target. For the 20-year target, the biodiversity targets for individual ecosystems were adjusted so
that they would cumulatively add up to the CBD target, which was 12% at that time for terrestrial
areas. Specific habitat based protected area targets were set for each terrestrial habitat. More
general targets, that were not habitat based, were set for marine (20% of which 15% should be no-
take zones) and coastal systems (25% of the coast length of which 15% should be no-take zones).
Although the need for these targets was emphasised in the NPAES 2008, no specific targets could be
set for rivers, wetlands or estuaries, as suitable habitat maps were not yet available.

There are a number of issues relevant to protected area targets that have emerged since the NPAES
2008:

e The international CBD targets have increased to 17% of terrestrial and inland water, and 10% of
coastal and marine areas, and the timelines have been adjusted. Further, there is a far stronger
emphasis on the network needing to be ecologically representative and that the targets need to
be met by intact habitat that is ecologically functional and is conserved in protected areas and
other effective area-based conservation measures.

e The coast length target proved to be very difficult to monitor as the further you zoom into a
coastline, the more detail you see and the longer the line is. Also it is important to recognize that
natural ecosystems do not consist of a line, but rather consist of areas.

e Inaddition to the maps of terrestrial ecosystem types, we have how good maps of rivers,
wetlands, estuaries and marine ecosystems. We need to set targets for these features.
Unfortunately, these maps were separately created, with the consequence that one can have
different habitat types overlapping (e.g. a terrestrial ecosystem, a specific river type and a
wetland could all be mapped at the same site). This is clearly not the case on the ground, but
rather is an issue related to our current fragmented approach to ecosystem mapping® . This
means that if one just adds up the individual thresholds for these features that they will
artificially inflate the target required ™.

e The terrestrial ecosystem map has been updated, with the consequence that areas of specific
habitat types have changed. Similarly, both the wetland and marine ecosystem maps have had a
series of spatial updates.

®3 An integrated habitat map is a key priority for the National Biodiversity Assessment 2018.

°4 It has been argued that this does not matter as one would just add all the features together that are found at
a site when one is calculating protection levels. However, this could result in falsely targeting sites for protection
where the mapped features overlap. There would clearly be no rational ecological argument for this, as in reality
only one ecosystem is found at a site.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 103
 The NPAES has built on the principles and approach established for the NPAES 2008. The core
elements of this approach, which we have retained, are:

e Inthe long term, South Africa’s protected area targets should align with its established
biodiversity thresholds. This ensures that, in principle, enough of each ecosystem will be
protected to ensure that no further ecosystems can become Critically Endangered as
sufficient intact habitat would be secured in the long term to avoid crossing this threshold.
Further, alignment of the targets allows for consistent and aligned reporting.

e Targets should be specifically set for each ecosystem.

e Although overall the long term targets should meet the total CBD commitment, we optimize
the allocation across habitats to reflect differing levels of biodiversity, i.e. we increase
targets for diverse habitats, but reduce them in relatively low diversity habitats so that the
overall commitment in terms of area remains the same. This ensures an optimal biodiversity
outcome from our protected area expansion process.

e Over a 20-year period, South Africa’s protected area targets should aim to achieve its
commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity even if the convention’s
timelines are not adhered to.

e Shorter term targets are calculated as a proportion of the 20-year target i.e. the 5 year
target is a quarter of the 20 year target.

In addition, the following principles have been added:

e Targets should also be set for marine, wetland, river and estuarine features at the ecosystem
level.

e Targets can be met only by intact habitat. This principle was established in the NPAES 2008
but was only partially implemented as only artificial waterbodies were excluded at that time.

e Targets can be met in protected areas and other areas with effective area-based
conservation measures. Currently, we only evaluate protected areas, as these are the only
areas where biodiversity is currently legally secured. In the future, once other area based
conservation mechanisms have been secured effectively (e.g. through having intact natural
areas of biospheres strictly zoned for conservation, subject to robust and effective land use
controls, and have well-capacitated management authorities), it is anticipated that the intact
and secure areas zoned for conservation under these other measures will also contribute to
meeting targets.

e Targets for features should not be artificially inflated by having falsely overlapping habitat
maps.

e The approach should be to set out clear principles for target setting, so that when habitat
maps inevitably improve, biodiversity targets are refined (e.g. through more detailed
biodiversity survey of aquatic habitats), or political commitments change (e.g. a revised CBD
target), that it is a minor administrative and GIS task to recalculate the area required. A key
element of this is that we need to move away from being fixated by the area measurement
of target, which is in fact a secondary calculation, and rather realize that the area required is
a function of the percentage of the habitat that is required and the mapped original extent
of the feature.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 104
 Technical Note 2: Calculating targets

Targets are a fundamental building block guiding the design, implementation and evaluation of any
protected area network that aims to be fully representative of all biodiversity. As discussed in the
main body of the NPAES and in Technical Note One, targets for each ecosystem are a function of the
original extent of that ecosystem; the proportion of the ecosystem that needs to be conserved to
retain all its key biodiversity pattern and process (i.e. the biodiversity target); the political,
administrative and practical considerations of how much to expand the protected area network; and
finally, interim targets are influenced by timelines for implementation. All of these elements are
however subject to change. For example, additional wetlands could be mapped which changes the
original extent, new surveys could result in better biodiversity targets being set, the Aichi
biodiversity targets related to CBD commitments could be altered, and finally a protected area
expansion strategy may be implemented over a longer period. Therefore, the NPAES has established
a system that sets robust targets, but which can be quickly and easily updated when changes in any
of the input elements occurs. Ideally, it should be a minor GIS and administrative task to recalculate
the required target.

The target calculation is undertaken for each ecosystem® using the following steps:

1. Identify the appropriate biodiversity target percentage to use for the ecosystem in question®.
These currently range from 16 to 36% for terrestrial ecosystems, with a 20% target used for
other ecosystems. The appropriate biodiversity threshold for each ecosystem is published in the
latest National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA). Should the biodiversity thresholds, as published
in the NBA change (e.g. as a result of research which improves our knowledge of the portion of a
specific ecosystem which needs to be kept intact to conserve all its biodiversity elements), this
change should also be applied to the NPAES. This percentage value should be used as the long-
term protected area target. Securing this area in effectively managed protected areas will in
theory ensure that no further ecosystems will become Critically Endangered, though obviously
this opportunity has already been lost for many systems. Aligning the values also allows for
robust and consistent assessment, and full alignment between the NPAES and the NBA.

2. Calculate the required area to secure the long-term protected area target. This is achieved by
calculating the area of the ecosystem on an appropriate map, and multiplying this by the long-
term protected area target percentage.

3. Establish the relationship between the total area required to meet long term protected area
target for all ecosystems and the total area committed to politically or administratively. To do
this we added up all the areas required to meet long-term protected area targets and divided it
by the total area committed to under the CBD (i.e. 17% of inland and 10% for marine

®5 The NPAES uses this target setting method on the integrated ecosystem map that was created for this
project. However, if the method described above is applied to a different ecosystem map (e.g. a more detailed
ecosystem map for a province), the overall outcome will still deliver the required total area to meet national
targets. Hence, provinces can use their own maps, and still be confident that if this method is applied that they
will be compatible with national requirements. Targets can even be calculated individually for ecosystem maps
that are not integrated. The overall alignment with the NPAES will be retained so long as target achievement
for individually mapped systems is also separately evaluated.

®6 So long as this method is applied in full, even if a province has set its own different biodiversity targets for
ecosystem types, the final total requirement will still be compatible with the overall requirement for meeting
national protected area targets.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 105
 ecosystems). We did the calculation separately for terrestrial and marine systems. As they are
mixed systems with terrestrial and marine elements, we treated coastal ecosystems which have
a land component as terrestrial. This also ensures better alignment with current planning
initiatives. Based on current values, 50% of the long-term biodiversity target is required for all
non-coastal marine systems, while 78.63% of the long term biodiversity target is required for all
other ecosystems*”.

4. Combined the long-term protected area target with the appropriate proportion from point 3 to
calculate the 20-year protected area target.

5. Shorter term protected area targets (e.g. a 5-year target) are calculated as a portion of the 20-
year target.

Figure A 1: An integrated ecosystem map was created for South Africa. The map includes 969 distinct

of South African territory including its EEZ. The inset shows the Prince Edward Islands and their

are shown in the second insert. This is the first time an integrated ecosystem map is available for
South Africa.

The preparation of a fully integrated ecosystem map covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine,
coastal and marine ecosystems was a key activity for the NPAES (Figure A 1). Without the map,
accurate targets cannot be set and monitoring of achievement of targets is problematic. Although

°7 These percentages can be directly applied to any ecosystem and its biodiversity target on any habitat map
for South Africa, so long as the target for that ecosystem is aligned with the target from the NBA. There is no
need to recalculate each step if there is no change to the CBD commitment. This allows rapid calculations to be
made in provincial PAES assessments where more refined ecosystem maps are used.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 106
 good maps of the individual ecosystem types now exist, these maps were separately created, with
the consequence that one can have different habitat types overlapping. We therefore undertook a
mapping process to develop an integrated map. We identified 26 biozones® (which are similar to
biomes but are not just applicable in terrestrial units) which include 969 distinct ecosystems. A map
showing the biozones is provided in Figure A 2 and a summary of biozones and ecosystems is given
in Table A 2.

The mapping used the following building blocks:

e Terrestrial Ecosystems: The revised 2012 National vegetation map®. There are 450 ecosystem
types in 12 biozones. These biozones are very similar to the corresponding terrestrial biome, but
will have a reduced area as some portions of the unit will now be mapped as wetlands or rivers.

e Wetlands: Natural wetlands included in the 2015 revised national wetland map (4a) were
used’°. Wetlands were included at the group level, which has 136 distinct ecosystem types.
These are all included in 1 biozone as we do not currently have a reliable basis on which to
divide these systems.

e Coastal and marine types: The integrated coastal and benthic ecosystem maps prepared for the
National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 was used as the starting point”’. An additional ecosystem
was defined for all marine areas in the Southern Oceans which were not previously included in
the national map. There are 109 benthic and coastal ecosystem types, 16 pelagic types and 1
Southern Ocean type distributed across 9 biozones.

e Estuaries: Estuary types were mapped based on the outlines in the National Estuary map 2012
and the classification in Whitfield (1992). There are 46 estuary ecosystem types in 3 biozones.

e Rivers: River ecosystems were based on the NFEPA classification and dataset (Nel et al., 2011).
There are 126 distinct ecosystem types. As this map treats rivers as lines with no area, we
approximated river areas by buffering rivers based on stream order, with the smallest rivers
having a 30m buffer and largest ones 210m.

The individual components were integrated into a single map created at a 30m resolution using a
simple rule based approach whereby wetlands and estuaries overrode all other layers; rivers
overrode terrestrial ecosystems; and terrestrial ecosystems overrode marine and coastal systems.
The approach is not ideal, but until the National Biodiversity Assessment 2018 when an integrated
ecosystem map is anticipated to be a core product, this map developed for the NPAES is likely to be
the best available.

8 The term biozone is used as it is more compatible with the ecosystem classifications in marine and estuarine
systems than a biome. For terrestrial systems the concept is identical to a biome, but the actual mapped

extent of the terrestrial biozone will be different to its associated biome. This is caused by the fact that an area
which was a single biome (e.g. Grasslands) was divided into terrestrial, river and wetland areas. This will clearly
reduce the total mapped extent of the Grasslands.

that Orange River mouth were also included.

biozones.

A second mapping input required for the evaluation of achievement of targets is an ecosystem
condition map. The underlying principle is that areas that are no longer intact (e.g. large dams,
roads, rest camps, canalized sections of rivers and plantations of exotic trees) should not contribute
to targets even if they are in protected areas. Hence, the preparation of a fully integrated ecosystem
condition map covering terrestrial, river, wetland, estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems was a
key activity for the NPAES. Although good maps of individual ecosystem condition now exist, these
maps had not previously been integrated. A map was developed for the NPAES that identified good,
fair and poor condition areas of each ecosystem (Figure A 3).

The mapping primarily used DEA’s recently released National Land Cover (NLC 2013/2014)” for
inland areas. The 72 land cover or land use classes were each classified as either good (for natural
and semi-natural areas), fair (for degraded systems) or poor (for heavily modified systems such as
mining, plantation, arable agriculture or urban land uses). For marine ecosystems, estuaries, rivers
and wetlands the ecosystem condition maps developed for the respective components of the
National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 were used. The layers were used to develop individual

National Land Cover as being in fair or poor condition, this value overrode any other input as it was
likely to be more accurate. This process produced the first ever integrated ecosystem condition map
for South Africa.

 Appendix 3: Review of implementation of Phase 1 of the NPAES (2008 — 2014)

The first phase of the National Protected Area Expansion Strategy, covering the period 2008 — 2014,
has been completed”’. This appendix serves to review the progress made in implementing Phase 1
of the NPAES. This review reports on progress made in: (i) the formal declaration of new areas as
protected areas; (ii) the negotiation (but not yet completed) of new areas for declaration as
protected areas; (iii) the development of institutionally-based PAES’s; (iv) the implementation of
different protected area expansion mechanisms; (v) securing financial and human resources to
support protected area expansion efforts; and (vi) the development of the enabling conditions (legal,
policy, information management, incentives, cooperative governance) for protected area expansion.
Based on the lessons learnt in the implementation of phase 1 of the NPAES, the review further
identifies key challenges to protected area expansion that will need to be addressed in phase 2 of
the NPAES in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of protected area expansion efforts.

1. New areas declared as protected areas

In Phase 1 of the NPAES, a total area of 189 433.36km? was added to the protected area system,
through 460 formal declarations. Over 95% (180 851.37km?) of this total is attributed to the
declaration of a single protected area, the Prince Edward Island marine protected area (situated in
the Prince Edward Island EEZ). Table A 3 presents a breakdown of the new areas declared as
protected areas during the period of review, by protected area type.

In the terrestrial environment, approximately 31% of the area originally targeted for expansion in
phase 1 (i.e. 27 000.00km? or 2.2% of the country’s surface area) was formally declared”. The spatial
distribution of the new areas included into the terrestrial protected area system, for the period of
review is shown in Figure A 4.

73 The actual timeframe for Phase 1 of the NPAES is 2008-2013. This review of progress was however only
initiated at the end of 2014. It was thus considered prudent to include 2014 into the period of review.
“4 No specific targets were however set for different protected area types.

Of the 830 322ha added to the terrestrial protected area system, over 560 000ha of this was
privately owned (502 692ha) or under some form of communal tenure (59 175ha), and declared
under a contractual agreement without a change in ownership (Table A 4). This suggests that the
negotiation of formal contractual agreements with people who have private or communal land
tenure has become the primary tool for protected area expansion in terrestrial habitats (see
discussion in section 2).

Most protected area agencies, with the exception of Limpopo and Free State, concluded new
terrestrial protected area declarations in Phase 1 (see also Table A ).

75 At the time that the NPAES (2008) was developed, there were many protected areas that were functioning
as de facto protected areas but were not formally declared. These areas were included in national protected
area calculations. Formalising their status by declaring them was identified as an important mechanism for
protected area expansion — although this did not expand the actual area. De facto protected areas that have
been proclaimed are recorded here.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 112
 The NPAES established the important principle of representing each habitat type within the
protected area network, and set representation targets for each of South Africa’s terrestrial habitat
types’®. Table A gives a summary of the NPAES targets for land-based protected areas, and
summarizes progress towards meeting them’”’”®. As only intact areas contribute to meeting
representation targets, the new DEA land-cover database was used to evaluate the actual
contribution existing and expanded protected areas make by removing impacted areas such as
dams, rest camps, roads and fields. For this reason”, the total areas contributing to meeting
representation targets for habitats are less than the full area of protected area added. This is
particularly the case for Protected Environments which often consist of a mosaic of different land
uses.

Table A shows that progress towards meeting the targets set in the NPAES has been mixed. When
all habitats are considered, the areas effectively contributing to meeting targets improved from 3.6%
to 3.9% (based on current protected areas), and will move to 4.2% if additional sites under
negotiation are all completed®°. Currently, this equates to 18% of the 5-year target and 4.5% of the
20-year target. Should all areas under negotiation be completed, 8.3% of the 20-year target will have
been met. Clearly progress towards meeting targets has been slower than the NPAES proposed. Best
progress (as measured by the % of the 5-year target met) has been made in the Forest biome, where
the area declared exceeds the short term target with 129% of the target being achieved, while good
progress was also made in the waterbodies biome and the Albany Thicket biome with 91% and 69%
of the 5-year targets being met respectively. No progress was made in the Desert biome and Indian
Ocean coastal Belt, and little progress was made in the Nama-Karoo, Savanna and Grassland biomes
with only 9%, 14% and 16% respectively of the 5-year targets being met. Two biomes which were
not include in the NPAES (2008) (i.e. the Subantarctic Tundra biome and the Polar Desert biome) are
both fully protected.

76 Habitat specific representation targets could not be set for freshwater, marine and coastal types in the
NPAES in 2008 as no suitable habitat maps existed at that time. These targets are set in NPAES 2016.

7” Detailed data for each individual ecosystem type are given in the Appendix 1.

78 Importantly, there are major differences between the NPAES 2008 spatial data, the current spatial data and
the summaries of the areas declared that were submitted by the different protected area agencies. In addition
to the landcover related issue, a fundamental issue is that many of the protected areas legally declared during
the period 2008 to 2014 were already included as De facto protected areas in the NPAES 2008. We have hence
developed a protected area layer specifically for the evaluation of habitat representation that examines the
effective extent of protection. The figure in the habitat representation layer cannot be directly compared with
the protected area declaration data.

79 This, along with updates on the base protected area data layer, results in the protected area extent reported
in the NPAES 2008 differing from the 2008 figures used in the current evaluation.

®0 These figures are far smaller than the full extent of the protected network as many Lowveld Savanna, Arid
Savanna and Mountain Fynbos types are over-represented in terms of habitat targets. This does not imply that
there are not excellent reasons to protect these extra areas (e.g. securing threatened species, protection of
areas supplying water, securing habitat for wide-ranging species, protecting full functioning ecosystems,
securing the country against climate change, and to support the tourism industry), but merely that these areas
are beyond the minimum required habitat representation target.

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016

114
 Table A and Table A show that although progress has been slower than anticipated, the expansion
has largely been in areas which increase the efficiency and representivity of the protected area
network. The NPAES identified 42 focus areas for land-based protected area expansion. Overall 59%
(or 662 301ha) of the current expansion took place in these priority focus areas (Figure A 5). Of the
current areas under negotiation, a far lower percentage (36% or 200 623ha) are within the priority
focus areas. Importantly, as the priority focus areas identified in the NPAES examined only large
intact priorities and not fragmented threatened habitats or finer scale provincial priorities, this does
not imply that the current expansion outside of the focus areas is poorly located. Nor does it imply
that the areas under negotiation are less of a priority.

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 116
  

In the marine environment, the declaration of the marine protected area (MPA) in the Prince

Edward Island (PEI) EEZ resulted in marine protected areas far exceeding the short- and long-term
NPAES targets (by a factor of 2) for the PEI EEZ. However, during the period of review no offshore
MPAs were declared (against a short-term target of 52 500 km? in the NPAES) for the mainland EEZ
and only 2 inshore MPAs (27 878 ha®+) were declared, resulting in an under-representation of these
habitats in meeting the overall targets for the marine protected area system. The spatial distribution
of the new areas included into the marine protected area system for the period of review is shown
in Figure A 4.

Table A summarizes the progress towards achieving specific NPAES targets in the Marine Inshore
and Marine Offshore environments. As no suitable habitat maps existed when the NPAES 2008 was
undertaken no habitat specific representation targets were set at that time, and therefore we can
only evaluate progress across these environments as a whole. Overall, better progress has been
made in the marine environment than in terrestrial areas.

* Note that it is clear how much no-take area will be declared

In particular, good progress has been made in the marine offshore: Prince Edward Islands EEZ
region, where the 20-year no-take target and the overall protected area target have effectively both
been met through the declaration of the Prince Edward Islands Marine Protected Area. Progress in
the marine inshore and marine offshore (mainland) EEZ environments has not matched that around
the Prince Edward Islands. In the marine offshore (mainland) EEZ environment the protected area
network was extremely limited in 2008 with only 0.4% of the area being protected (and only 0.16%
being no-take). During phase 1 an additional 0.03% of the marine offshore (mainland) EEZ
environment was declared of which 0.02% is no-take. This represents under 1% of the 5-year NPAES
target. Progress in improving the current representation is likely to be better in phase 2 as significant

61 The NPAES set a short-term target of 88km of coastline for inshore MPAs, but no area-based targets.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 117
 areas in this environment (representing 6.7% of the area and 32% of the 20-year target) are under
negotiation through Operation Phakisa.

The 2008 baseline for the marine inshore environment, was 20.6% (741km) having some protection
of which 7.9% (285km) was no-take. Eighty nine percent of the phase 1 target for no-take areas was
met, while 163% of the 5-year target for overall inshore protection was met. Progress on no-take
MPAs has been slower than required and will require specific attention in future phases of the
NPAES.

2. Areas still under active negotiation for inclusion into the protected area
network (2008 — 2014)

The areas still under active negotiation for future declaration as terrestrial protected areas — totaling
some 1 180 997ha® — vary widely between protected area institutions (Figure A 6).

3. Mechanisms for expansion

In the terrestrial environment, the conclusion of a contractual agreement between the protected
area institution and a landowner or land user (in the case of communal land) was the primary
mechanism used to declare new terrestrial protected areas during phase 1 of the NPAES (Table A ).

Of the total land incorporated into the terrestrial protected area system, contractual agreements

accounted for 68% (563 947ha) of the extent of declared protected areas. Ninety three percent of
the area under contractual agreements (522 128ha) was brokered on private and communal land

through the biodiversity stewardship programmes.

Although the process of formally assigning and declaring state land accounted for 39% of the
declarations, the extent of declared protected areas (157 743ha) comprised only 19% of the total
expansion in phase 1.

SANParks is the only protected area institution which purchased land (106 663ha) for protected area
expansion in phase 1.

Four protected area institutions formalised the declaration of state owned land that was already
being managed as de facto protected areas (but not yet declared), while seven protected area
institutions concluded contractual agreements for the declaration of protected areas (Table A ). Of

 the land managed under contractual agreement, 29% (161 810ha) is managed by the state while the
remainder is privately managed.

All three protected area mechanisms - contractual agreement, land acquisition and declaration of
state owned land - were used in the expansion of National Parks and Nature Reserves. Contractual
agreements were the only expansion mechanism used in the establishment of Protected
Environments, while the declaration of state owned land was the only expansion mechanism used

 

for Forest Nature Reserves (Table A ).

 4. The development of institutionally-based Protected Area Expansion
Strategy’s (PAES) (2008 — 2014)

In the terrestrial environment, only one protected area institution - CapeNature - had a PAES (in the
form of a Biodiversity Stewardship Plan) in 2008. By the end of phase 1 however, eight of the twelve
protected area institutions have now developed, adopted and are implementing an institutionally-
based PAES. These institutionally-based PAES’s are all closely aligned to the strategic objectives of
the NPAES, although the implementation phases are not yet fully harmonised (Table A ).

Three of the remaining protected area institutions (Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape) are
currently developing or have developed their own PAES’s and are in the process of getting them
adopted. Only one protected area institution — DAFF — currently has no plans to develop an
institutionally-based PAES and is using the NPAES to guide its priorities for protected area expansion.

institutions.

Expansion plans for the marine environment are well developed and were recently published as part
of Operation Phakisa. The total area targeted for expansion of the MPA network is 64 807.10km?
(covering 21 separate MPAs in the inshore and off-shore mainland EEZ).

5. Resource allocations to PAES (2014)

The institutional capacity to implement the protected area expansion programme is limited. An
estimate of the human resources® available (as of end December 2014) for implementing the
protected area expansion programme is presented in Table A .

85 Human resource estimates are inclusive of relevant senior management, stewardship managers, negotiators
and facilitators, planners, legal staff, ecologists, technicians and extension staff.

86 Staff availability is broken down into those staff that spend more than 60% of their time on protected area
expansion and those who have a role to play but spend less than 60% of their time on the function.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 121
 The estimated operational®’ budgets for protected area expansion are highly variable (Table A 14).
The funding resources for protected area expansion, and the actual performance of the protected
area agency in declaring new areas as protected areas, do not show a close correlation which
suggests that some agencies are more efficient in expanding their protected areas.

6. Legal and institutional developments (2008 — 2014)

Phase 1 of the NPAES (2008) saw a number of legal and administrative developments aimed at
advancing protected area expansion. These include:

e The amendment of the Protected Areas Act to include marine protected areas.

e The process of developing standardised stewardship guidelines was advanced.

e Refinements in the incentives for declaring privately owned and managed protected areas
through tax rebates.

e Improved levels of legislative compliance through the development of the Protected Area
Register.

e The advanced development of a protected area database, linked to the Protected Area
Register, which is populated with Stats SA-verified data only.

e The establishment of a national protected area co-ordination and standardisation forum (the
Protected Area Technical Task Team; PATTT), which includes the mandate for protected area
expansion.

e Publishing guidelines for the declaration of different types of protected areas.

7. Key protected area expansion issues and challenges (2008 — 2014)

The review process brought to light a number of key issues and concerns that warrant consideration
in the development of an action plan for phase 2 of the NPAES. These include inter alia:

e Inadequate funds to increase and sustain the biodiversity stewardship programme: All
protected area institutions involved in the biodiversity stewardship programme highlighted
the concern that as more areas were being successfully contracted under the biodiversity
stewardship programme, the need for maintenance engagements and auditing of these sites
increases. This maintenance and auditing function thus requires a greater slice of the current
budget as well as increased staff time. Attention needs to be paid to ways of covering the
increasing maintenance costs of the biodiversity stewardship programme while maintaining
adequate resources to continue with protected area expansion efforts.

87 This includes budgets that institutions have for land purchase.

 

National Protected Area Expansion Strategy 2016 122
 e Declining availability of funds for the SANParks land purchase fund: The purchase by
SANParks of key land for protected area expansion was possible through the land purchase
fund. This fund is dependent on ad hoc grants from DEA to function and these grants have
been cut substantially in recent years.

e Staff numbers, staff turnover, staff capacity and institutional support: Many protected area
institutions raised the need for their agency to better align their staffing (both in terms of
numbers and capacity) with the requirements of implementing their institutional PAESs. A
range of skills and expertise is required to successfully declare new protected areas, from
field-based negotiators to stewardship managers and from legal support to planners and
ecologists. Mention was made of the negative effects of high staff turnover and the need for
improving the career paths of individuals involved in protected area expansion efforts.

e Data and data management: The review has highlighted the widespread need for improved
data and data management systems to ensure that the protected area expansion function is
being based on reliable, updated and accessible information.

e Alignment of the NPAES and institutional level plans: Not all institutional PAES plans are
aligned with the national plans. This may result in areas being added to the protected area
system which contribute little towards target achievement. The need to promote better
alignment between the NPAES and the institutionally-based PAESs has been highlighted.

e Legal and administrative barriers: All institutions indicated that administrative (including
legal) barriers were one of the major bottlenecks in declaring new protected areas. The need
for a task team to identify the major barriers and to seek ways to remove or reduce them
was identified as important in taking the protected area expansion programme forward.
