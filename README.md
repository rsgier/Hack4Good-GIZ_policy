# Tracing policy implementation of NDCs (Paris Agreement on climate change)
The goal of this project is to develop an NLP solution that processes documents that might be of interest to evaluating progress towards contributions outlined in the Paris Agreement on climate change, or other policy frameworks. The solution uses a variety of NLP processing techniques, keyword searching, and sentence embedding through a pretrained neural network to create metrics which are tied together in a coherence score, used to indicate how strongly a document relates to the subjects imporntant to the policy framework in question.

# Overview
The root directory contains dependency files and a setup python executable to aid in setting up your coding environment. The following directories are present

- __code__: contains all python executables and jupyter notebooks which carry out computations for meeting project goals. All python executables contain documented, modularized functions. The jupyter notebooks serve to demonstrate the functionality of these executables. 
    - The __windows notebook__ is the most detailed and has the most up to date functions apart from the neural network embedding search tool (see examples of this in the embedding_examples notebook). It is a good place to start to understand the methods and tools and to visualize results within document sections with both heatmaps and rendering of the text. It includes the initial coherence and relevance scoring for the documents. 
    - The __embedding_examples__ notebook illustrates different functionalities of how the pretrained neural network can be used to prioritize sentences that most correlate with keywords, and for expanding the NDC keyword search.
    - The __corpus__ level notebook demonstrates keyword search at the document level to compare across documents, either using the simple matching method to find NDC words, or the sentence embedding through a pretrained neural network can be used to find/expand the NDC word searches at the document level. 
    - The __document__ level notebook is a sort of in between, and represents a somewhat earlier stage of work but not as early as the __1stPhase__ notebook - these notebooks were included mostly for the purposes of facilitating seeing how the work evolved over the course of the project, and are not meant to be built upon necessarily.

- __ndc_keywords__: contains `.json` files with keywords related to some of the NDCs for Ethiopia and South Africa. The notebook files in the code directory will load keywords from these files. 
- __test_resources__: contains transcripts (OCR'd from PDF documents) of legislation and reports that are used in example analysis

# Setup GIZ Project

We will be using python 3.8.x and a virtual python environment for this project.
All tools of the project work with python 3.8.x. Other python version might cause compatibility problems.

To set up the project run the following commands:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/analytics-club/hack4good/hack4good-fall-2021/giz-policy/giz-policy.git
cd giz-policy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python setup.py
```
This code block clones this repository, installs the virtual environment and installs all dependencies.

# First Steps

Now everything is ready for analyzing your array of documents. The working principle of our pipline is documented in our jupyter notebooks.
You can launch them by typing
```
jupyter-lab
```
and then just go into the `code` directory and choose the corresponding notebooks (all files ending with `.ipynb`).
To execute a code block just press `Shift + Enter`. For more information on our functions you can either make a new block (`Ctrl + B`) and execute `help(function_you_are_interested_in)`. Or you can just directly look at the documention in our module files (all files ending with `.py`)
